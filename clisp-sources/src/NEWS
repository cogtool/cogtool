User visible changes
--------------------

* SAVEINITMEM can create standalone executables.
  Thanks to Frank Buß <fb@frank-buss.de> for the idea.
  SAVEINITMEM also accepts :NORC argument do disable RC-file loading.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes/image.html> for details.

* POSIX:SYSLOG no longer recognizes "%m" and other formatting instructions.
  For your safety and security, please do all formatting in Lisp.

* Fixed the OPEN :IF-EXISTS :APPEND bug introduced in 2.37.

* Fixed a crash on woe32 in opening files with names longer than MAX_PATH.

* Module berkeley-db now supports Berkeley DB 4.4.


2.37 (2006-01-02)
=================

User visible changes
--------------------

* Signal a continuable error when an already opened file is opened again,
  unless both streams are read-only.

* SOCKET-SERVER now accepts :BACKLOG and :INTERFACE arguments.
  The first (optional) argument should be the port number or NIL.
  Use (SOCKET-SERVER NIL :INTERFACE SOCKET) instead of (SOCKET-SERVER SOCKET).
  Thanks to Tomas Zellerin <zellerin@gmail.com>.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes/socket.html#sose> for details.

* EXT:HTTP-PROXY now uses the environment variable "http_proxy", not
  "HTTP_PROXY", like curl does, to avoid confusing it with CGI arguments.

* OPEN :DIRECTION :OUTPUT now creates write-only handles and treats
  named pipes correctly.

* Fixed EXT:SETENV on non-POSIX systems (woe32 and BSD derivatives).

* Fixed a bug in EXT:! on 64-bit platforms.
  Thanks to Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>.


2.36 (2005-12-04)
=================

User visible changes
--------------------

* Infrastructure:
  + Top-level configure now accepts the option --enable-maintainer-mode
    that affects autoconf-related Makefile targets.  The default value
    is determined based on the presence of the CVS directories.
  + When libsigsegv is not found, print instructions on getting/building
    libsigsegv and bail out; override with --ignore-absence-of-libsigsegv.
  + When --with-dynamic-ffi is supplied, but the FFI fails to build, abort.
  + When --with-readline is supplied, but GNU readline is not found, abort.
  + makemake no longer checks with_module_* variables.

* New function EXT:OPEN-HTTP and macro EXT:WITH-HTTP-INPUT.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes/macros3.html#open-http> for details.

* New declaration EXT:NOTSPECIAL undoes the effects of DEFVAR and DEFCONSTANT.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes/declarations.html#notspec-decl>
  for details.

* Function EXT:CLHS is now deprecated in favor of DESCRIBE, which can now
  point your web browser to the ANSI CL and CLISP-specific documentation.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes/environment-dict.html#describe>
  for details.

* FFI modules can now take advantage of autoconf feature detection.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes/dffi.html#ffi-guard> for details.

* New FFI macro FFI:DEF-C-CONST.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes/dffi.html#def-c-const> for details.

* New charset BASE64 encodes arbitrary byte sequences with strings of
  printable ASCII characters (4 characters per 3 bytes).
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes/encoding.html#base64> for details.

* New module readline offers some advanced readline and history features.
  It is a BASE module and is available when both FFI and readline are present.

* SOCKET:SOCKET-SERVICE-PORT is now deprecated in favor of OS:SERVICE.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes/syscalls.html#service> for details.

* New SETF-able functions POSIX:GETUID, POSIX:GETGID, POSIX:GETEUID,
  POSIX:GETEGID.
  New functions POSIX:GROUP-INFO and POSIX:STRING-TIME.
  Function POSIX:USER-DATA is renamed to POSIX:USER-INFO.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes/syscalls.html> for details.

  Implemented XLIB:SET-MODIFIER-MAPPING, XLIB:KEYSYM->KEYCODES,
  XLIB:ACCESS-HOSTS, XLIB:ADD-ACCESS-HOST, XLIB:REMOVE-ACCESS-HOST,
  XLIB:CHANGE-KEYBOARD-CONTROL, XLIB:CHANGE-KEYBOARD-MAPPING,
  XLIB:KEYBOARD-MAPPING, XLIB:KEYSYM-NAME, XLIB:KEYCODE->CHARACTER,
  XLIB:SHAPE-EXTENTS, XLIB:SHAPE-RECTANGLES, XLIB:DEFAULT-KEYSYM-INDEX.
  Use MAP instead of ELT for sequence access in NEW-CLX.

* ANSI CL compliance issues:
  + DEFPACKAGE options :SHADOWING-IMPORT-FROM, :USE, :IMPORT-FROM
    accept package designators, not just package names.
  + ENCODE-UNIVERSAL-TIME is now the perfect inverse for DECODE-UNIVERSAL-TIME.

* The command line option -v now affects *LOAD-ECHO* also.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/clisp.html#opt-v> for details.

* When a CLISP process is killed, clean-up is always executed.

* DEFCLASS now permits user-defined :ALLOCATION arguments.

* Fixed (FUNCTION-LAMBDA-EXPRESSION #'(SETF FOO)) on compiled functions.

* Fixed re-exporting symbols from POSIX to EXT.

* Fixed module rawsock on platforms with non-trivial struct sockaddr layout.
  Functions that take a BUFFER argument, also take :START and :END arguments.
  Renamed RAWSOCK:LISTEN to RAWSOCK:SOCK-LISTEN to avoid a conflict with CL.
  New functions RAWSOCK:PROTOCOL, RAWSOCK:NETWORK, RAWSOCK:GETADDRINFO,
  RAWSOCK:GETNAMEINFO.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes/rawsock.html> for details.

* Fixed module postgresql logging behavior.

* Fixed clisp.h generation to conform to the internal definitions.


2.35 (2005-08-29)
=================

User visible changes
--------------------

* SOCKET:SOCKET-STREAM-SHUTDOWN does not call CLOSE anymore,
  just shutdown(2) - as it has always been documented.
  It now also works on raw sockets, thus RAWSOCK:SHUTDOWN has been removed.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#sost-shut> and
  <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#rawsock> for details.

* When the command line option -E receives an invalid encoding,
  ISO-8859-1 is used instead. [It was ASCII (for *FOREIGN-ENCODING*) or
  UTF-8 (for all other encodings) before.]
  Rationale: this is a 1:1 that corresponds to CLISP CODE-CHAR/CHAR-CODE
  and avoids spurious errors in DIRECTORY on startup.

* New function EXT:COMPILED-FILE-P - checks whether the file is a
  CLISP-compiled file with a compatible bytecode format.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#compiled-file-p> for details.

* New functions EXT:CHAR-INVERTCASE, EXT:STRING-INVERTCASE and
  EXT:NSTRING-INVERTCASE invert case of characters and strings.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#char-invertcase> and
  <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#string-invertcase> for details.

* New function POSIX:STREAM-OPTIONS calls fcntl(2).
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#fcntl> for details.

* Explicitly close all possible file descriptors before exec().

* Danish translations of the user interface messages have been added.
  Thanks to Dennis Decker Jensen <dennisdjensen@tiscali.dk>.



2.34 (2005-07-20)
=================

Important notes
---------------

* All .fas files generated by previous CLISP versions are invalid and
  must be recompiled.  This is caused by the addition of MOP, the DEFSETF
  fixes, and the TRANSLATE-PATHNAME and MAKE-HASH-TABLE enhancements.
  Set CUSTOM:*LOAD-OBSOLETE-ACTION* to :COMPILE to automate this.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#loadfile> for details.

* The name of the Run-Control file has changed from '_clisprc' to
  '.clisprc' on all platforms.
  If you are using woe32, please rename your Run-Control file.

* Modules i18n, regexp, and syscalls are now present even in the base
  linking set.  Do not pass, e.g., "--with-module=regexp" to configure.

  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#fill-stream> for details.

* SUBTYPEP can determine subtype relationship and type equivalence much better
  than it could before.

* When *PRINT-READABLY* is true, symbols are now printed with package marker
  and vertical bars.

* ANSI CL compliance issues:
  + Issue <DECLARATION-SCOPE:NO-HOISTING> is implemented: The scope of
    declarations that do not apply to bindings, such as free SPECIAL, NOTINLINE
    or OPTIMIZE declarations, includes only the body forms and no longer
    includes the initforms of the LAMBDA/LET/LET*/MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND bindings.
  + Vectors of element type NIL are now strings in all aspects. But the type
    BASE-STRING does _not_ include vectors of element type NIL.
  + TYPE-OF now returns STANDARD-CHAR instead of CHARACTER when possible.
  + The type COMPILED-FUNCTION no longer encompasses generic functions.
  + TYPE-OF now returns COMPILED-FUNCTION or STANDARD-GENERIC-FUNCTION instead
    of FUNCTION when possible.
  + The space character is printed as "#\ " if CUSTOM:*PRINT-SPACE-CHAR-ANSI*
    is true.
  + The #<PACKAGE KEYWORD> no longer has the nickname "". The syntax :FOO for
    keywords still works, but is now special cased in the reader.
  + Class redefinition with DEFCLASS no longer modifies the previous class if
    it doesn't have a "proper name".
  + Class redefinition with DEFCLASS removes accessor methods that have been
    installed through the previous DEFCLASS definition of the same class.
  + Generic function redefinition with DEFGENERIC removes methods that have
    been installed through the previous DEFGENERIC definition of the same
    function.
  + The set of qualifiers allowed for methods that are combined with a method
    combination defined through the short form of DEFINE-METHOD-COMBINATION
    now includes the name of the method combination instead of the operator.
  + FIND-METHOD now gives an error if the list of specializers has a wrong
    length.
  + ARRAY-TOTAL-SIZE-LIMIT, ARRAY-DIMENSION-LIMIT, ARRAY-RANK-LIMIT are now
    fixnums.
  + SHORT-FLOATs whose absolute value is an integer in the range between 10^5
    and 10^7 are now printed with full precision.
  + Operations combining rational and floating-point numbers now return a
    floating-point result if CUSTOM:*FLOATING-POINT-RATIONAL-CONTAGION-ANSI*
    is true. When the mathematical result in a situation is rational, a
    warning is issued if CUSTOM:*WARN-ON-FLOATING-POINT-RATIONAL-CONTAGION* is
    true.
  + Class redefinition with DEFCLASS now updates existing instances as
    specified.
  + An ABORT restart is now always installed.
  + UPDATE-INSTANCE-FOR-DIFFERENT-CLASS does the required argument checking.
  + Passing invalid initialization arguments to MAKE-INSTANCE and similar
    now generates a PROGRAM-ERROR instead of just an ERROR.
  + Documentation strings are now attached to class objects, not just to
    their name.
  + Arrays with total array size 0 are printed in a lossy way if
    CUSTOM:*PRINT-EMPTY-ARRAYS-ANSI* is true and *PRINT-READABLY* is false.
  + Allow () to match NIL in destructuring lambda lists.
  + Documentation strings at a place where only declarations and forms are
    allowed now give a warning, not an error.
  + LAST, BUTLAST and NBUTLAST check their list argument for circularity.
  + Different LOAD-TIME-VALUE forms that are EQUAL but not EQ are no longer
    coalesced by COMPILE-FILE.
  + DEFSETF lambda-lists now support &ENVIRONMENT.
  + DEFSETF lambda-lists are no longer destructuring lambda-lists.
  + NAMESTRING no longer accepts an optional second argument.
  + SETF of VALUES now uses only the first value of each subform.
  + SPECIAL declarations of variables are now correctly respected inside
    macro expanders defined through MACROLET within the declaration's scope.
  + (EXPORT NIL), (UNEXPORT NIL), (IMPORT NIL), (SHADOWING-IMPORT NIL),
    (SHADOW NIL) are now nops.
  + An attempt to create a condition from an invalid condition designator now
    always results in a TYPE-ERROR being signalled.
  + The reader's errors are now of type READER-ERROR when they should be.
  + READ-DELIMITED-LIST now returns NIL when *READ-SUPPRESS* is true.
  + Printing of multidimensional arrays now respects *PRINT-LEVEL*.
  + As required by 19.2.3, *DEFAULT-PATHNAME-DEFAULTS* is merged into
    pathnames before accessing the file system.
  + LOGICAL-PATHNAME now gives an error if the argument string does not
    contain a host specification.
  + The PRINT-UNREADABLE macro prints extraneous spaces if
    CUSTOM:*PRINT-UNREADABLE-ANSI* is true.
  + In the #n= and #n# reader syntax, the integer n may now be larger than
    7 digits.
  + IN-PACKAGE forms with constant arguments are no longer executed by the
    compiler if they occur in a non-null lexical environment.
  + COMPILE-FILE now always returns the TRUENAME of its output file.
  + GET-SETF-EXPANSION now accepts NIL as the environment argument to
    mean null lexical environment
  Thanks to Paul F. Dietz <dietz@dls.net> and his ANSI compliance
  suite, which helped detect some of these deficiencies.
  Thanks to Yuji Minejima <ggb01164@nifty.ne.jp> and his ANSI compliance
  suite, which helped detect some of these deficiencies.

* Global error handlers can now be installed and removed using
  EXT:SET-GLOBAL-HANDLER, EXT:WITHOUT-GLOBAL-HANDLERS,
  and -on-error command line option.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#global-handler> and
  <http://clisp.cons.org/clisp.html#opt-on-error> for details.

* TRANSLATE-PATHNAME and TRANSLATE-LOGICAL-PATHNAME accept a new keyword
  argument :ABSOLUTE which makes them convert their return values to
  absolute pathnames.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#translate-pathname> and
  <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#translate-logpath> for details.

* New function EXT:ABSOLUTE-PATHNAME.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#absolute-pathname> for details.

* New function EXT:ELASTIC-NEWLINE and new FORMAT directive "~.".
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#elastic-newline>
  and <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#format-dot> for details.
  Through this function, CLISP no longer produces spurious blank lines when
  a program uses the convention of printing a #\Newline before each line.

* TRACE has a new option :MAX-DEPTH, that is useful to avoid infinite
  recursions in the tracer.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#trace> for details.

* The function LENGTH and a few other sequence functions now signal a
  TYPE-ERROR when a circular list has been given as argument.

* Function UPGRADED-COMPLEX-PART-TYPE is now as precise as possible.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#ucpt> for details.

* In non-interactive batch mode, *ERROR-OUTPUT* now uses the system's
  standard error stream, instead of the standard output stream.

* The macros MUFFLE-CERRORS, APPEASE-CERRORS and EXIT-ON-ERROR now treat
  CONTINUE restarts which require interactive user intervention like other
  restarts. Only non-interactive CONTINUE restarts are silently invoked.

* LOAD :OBSOLETE-ACTION can now also be :COMPILE to automatically
  recompile the obsolete *.fas file.
  LOAD can now ignore erroneous forms using SKIP and STOP restarts.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#loadfile> for details.

* References from within macros defined through MACROLET to variables or
  functions defined in the lexical environment outside the MACROLET form
  now signal an error. Previously, this resulted in undefined behavior.

* The FFI recognizes the c-type declaration (FFI:C-POINTER <c-type>) to
  handle references without conversion to/from Lisp structures.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#c-pointer> for details.

* The FFI variable FFI:*FOREIGN-ENCODING* can now be a multibyte encoding.
  The warning "*FOREIGN-ENCODING*: reset to ASCII" at startup is gone.

* New FFI constructor functions FFI:FOREIGN-VARIABLE and FFI:FOREIGN-FUNCTION,
  more operators are now exported (FFI:FOREIGN-VALUE, FFI:PARSE-C-TYPE).
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#dffi-make-var>
  and <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#dffi-make-func> for details.

* FFI macro FFI:C-LINES can now be used to fine-tune
  initialization and finalization.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#c-lines> for details.

* New FFI function FFI:CLOSE-FOREIGN-LIBRARY can be used to unload a library.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#dffi-close-lib> for details.

* New FFI low-level accessor FFI:MEMORY-AS.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#memory-as> for details.

* Foreign functions and variables can now be documented using the
  :DOCUMENTATION option to FFI:DEF-CALL-OUT and FFI:DEF-C-VAR.

* Buffered streams now are suitable for interactive streams. It is no longer
  necessary to use :BUFFERED NIL to avoid blocking in various situations.

* Function EXT:READ-BYTE-SEQUENCE takes a new keyword argument :INTERACTIVE.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#rd-by-seq> for details.

* Methods on GRAY:STREAM-READ-BYTE-SEQUENCE and GRAY:STREAM-WRITE-BYTE-SEQUENCE
  now need to accept a second optional argument.

* The possible values of the :WEAK argument of MAKE-HASH-TABLE are changed:
  Use :KEY-AND-VALUE instead of :EITHER, :KEY-OR-VALUE instead of :BOTH now.

* The :LIBRARY option argument to EXT:DEF-CALL-OUT and EXT:DEF-C-VAR is now
  evaluated (i.e., it can now be a variable) and may take a value of
  :DEFAULT and :NEXT in addition to being a string as before.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#def-c-var> and
  <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#def-call-out> for details.

* New user variable CUSTOM:*PRINT-SYMBOL-PACKAGE-PREFIX-SHORTEST*
  allows using the shortest package (nick)name as the symbol prefix.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#pr-sym-pack-prefix> for details.

* The user commands can now be extended using CUSTOM:*USER-COMMANDS*.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#user-commands> for details.

* Initialization and finalization of the CLISP process can now be
  augmented with CUSTOM:*INIT-HOOKS* and CUSTOM:*FINI-HOOKS*.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#init-hooks> and
  <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#fini-hooks> for details.

* SET functions (like UNION et al) are now much faster on large lists.

* The second, optional argument of EXT:SPECIAL-VARIABLE-P can no longer be T;
  please use (THE-ENVIRONMENT) instead.

* New function EXT:FEATUREP - the run-time version of read-time #+/#-.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#featurep> for details.

* Bug fixes:
  + The interpreter no longer executes the body of (EVAL-WHEN (COMPILE) ...)
    forms.
  + Fixes to internationalized error messages.
  + When an interpreted INITIALIZE-INSTANCE method uses CALL-NEXT-METHOD with
    a modified argument list, MAKE-INSTANCE could in some cases initialize
    the new object three times instead of just once.
  + Fixed a compiler bug that could lead to incorrect code when a LAMBDA
    with SPECIAL-declared optional variables was compiled inline and the
    initforms of the optional variables depended on the values of the previous
    optional variables.
  + Passing a package as second argument of RENAME-PACKAGE led to an
    unjustified error.
  + Passing a displaced vector as argument to REVERSE could lead to an
    unjustified error.
  + FRESH-LINE did not work in some situations.
  + Fixed ATANH on complex numbers.
  + The macros EXT:LETF and EXT:LETF* now work correctly on symbol-macros.
  + Fixed a spurious crash of MULTIPLE-VALUE-SETQ in interpreted code.
  + Fixed a crash of (COPY-READTABLE NIL some-readtable).
  + Fixed a crash when using a hash-table as hash-table key.
  + Fixed a crash triggered by the READ-BYTE function on streams with
    element type ([UN]SIGNED-BYTE n), 24 < n < 32, on big-endian platforms.
  + Fixed a crash that occurred on glibc platforms when writing Unicode
    characters in the range #\U000E0000..#\U000E007F on a stream with an
    encoding other than UTF-8.
  + An invalid bignum could be returned by GET-INTERNAL-RUN-TIME on 64-bit
    platforms.
  + Third party code walkers can now handle HANDLER-BIND et al.

* Woe32 distribution now comes with a binary driver clisp.exe.
  Do not copy it anywhere - create a shortcut to it instead!
  Use install.bat to automate shortcut creation.

2.33.1 (2004-05-22)
===================

User visible changes
--------------------

* Bug fixes:
  + The return value of ASINH was always rounded to a SINGLE-FLOAT.
  + The return value of NSTRING-UPCASE, NSTRING-DOWNCASE, NSTRING-CAPITALIZE,
    WRITE-STRING, WRITE-LINE, when called with a displaced string as argument,
    was wrong.

2.33 (2004-03-17)
=================

Important notes
---------------

* All .fas files generated by previous CLISP versions are invalid and
  must be recompiled.  Use CUSTOM:*LOAD-OBSOLETE-ACTION* to automate this.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#loadfile> for details.

User visible changes
--------------------

* NO-APPLICABLE-METHOD, NO-PRIMARY-METHOD and NO-NEXT-METHOD now signal
  METHOD-CALL-ERROR or METHOD-CALL-TYPE-ERROR.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#meth-call-err> for details.

* New user variables CUSTOM:*APROPOS-MATCHER* and CUSTOM::*APROPOS-DO-MORE*
  make APROPOS more flexible in search and output.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#apropos> for details.

* New function EXT:MOD-EXPT efficiently computes the composition of MOD
  and EXPT on integers.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#int-func-ext> for details.

* New function EXT:ARGV returns the command line arguments passed to runtime.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#argv> for details.

* New generic function GRAY:STREAM-POSITION extends FILE-POSITION to
  Gray streams; FILE-POSITION now works with streams other than FILE-STREAMs.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#gray> for details.

* DEFINE-METHOD-COMBINATION and friends are now implemented.
  Thanks to James Anderson <james.anderson@setf.de>.
  This change obsoleted all compiled file.

Portability
-----------

* Improved portability for nearly all platforms: Linux, MacOS X, Solaris,
  Tru64, HP-UX, AIX, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, BeOS.

* Removed Acorn RISCOS support.

2.32 (2003-12-29)
=================

User visible changes
--------------------

* WRITE-BYTE-SEQUENCE now accepts :NO-HANG keyword argument.
  Thanks to Don Cohen <don-sourceforge@isis.cs3-inc.com>.

* Support files larger than 2 GB or 4 GB on platforms with LFS
  (Large File Support).

* New module berkeley-db interfaces to
  <http://www.sleepycat.com/docs/api_c/frame.html>
  and allows working with Berkeley DB databases.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#berkeley-db> for details.

* New module pcre interfaces to <http://www.pcre.org/> and
  makes Perl Compatible Regular Expressions available in CLISP.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#pcre> for details.

* Module syscalls now exports function POSIX:STAT-VFS.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#syscalls> for details.

* When the system C library provides a wildcard (fnmatch) implementation,
  it is used instead of the GNU wildcard distributed with CLISP
  when the CLISP wildcard module is built.

* Prompt is now fully customizable by the user.
  CUSTOM:*PROMPT* is replaced with 5 variables.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#prompt> for details.

* Readline is now used properly on Cygwin/X11.

* Command line interface: the initial verbosity level is controlled
  by the pair of mutually canceling options -q/-v.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/clisp.html#opt-verbose> for details.


2.31 (2003-09-01)
=================

Important notes
---------------

* All .fas files generated by previous CLISP versions are invalid and
  must be recompiled.  This is not as bad as it was before: the invalid
  files will be ignored and the sources will be loaded instead of
  signaling an error unless you set CUSTOM:*LOAD-OBSOLETE-ACTION*.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#loadfile> for details.

* All custom-written external modules must be updated to reflect
  changes in the C definitions, e.g. many C types were renamed to a
  trailing _t (subr_t, object_initdata_t) and LISPFUN takes an
  additional side-effect class (seclass) parameter.

User visible changes
--------------------

* Added a new module - "fastcgi": an interface to the FastCGI
  Web server CGI-compatible protocol (see http://www.fastcgi.com/)
  Thanks to John K. Hinsdale <hin@alma.com>.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#fastcgi> for details.

* External modules now work on win32 (when used with cygwin or mingw).
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#mod-win32> for details.

* DIRKEY is now a standard module: use `--with-module=dirkey'
  instead of `--with-dir-key' when configuring.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#dirkey> for details.

* SYSCALLS is now a standard module: use `--with-module=syscalls
  instead of `--with-export-syscalls' when configuring.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#syscalls> for details.

* New module netica interfaces to <http://norsys.com/netica_c_api.htm>
  and allows working with Bayesian belief networks and influence diagrams.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#netica> for details.

* READ-BYTE-SEQUENCE now accepts :NO-HANG keyword argument.

* LOAD now takes an additional keyword argument :OBSOLETE-ACTION which
  specifies what to do with the obsolete .fas files.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#loadfile> for details.

* EXT:SPECIAL-VARIABLE-P now accepts a second optional ENVIRONMENT argument.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#spe-var-p> for details.

* You can now set socket options using new function SOCKET:SOCKET-OPTIONS.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#so-opt> for details.
  Suggested by Dave Richards <dave@synergy.org>.

* SOCKET:SOCKET-STATUS now distinguishes between :EOF and :INPUT.
  Also, it does not have to cons up a fresh list even for multiple streams.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#so-status> for details.

* CLISP character set now uses Unicode 3.2.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#characters> for details.

* DIRECTORY now accepts a new keyword argument :IF-DOES-NOT-EXIST which
  controls treatment of links pointing to non-existent files.
  It defaults to :DISCARD which is fully backward compatible.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#dir> for details.

* DELETE-FILE no longer calls TRUENAME on its argument, which enables
  you to delete symbolic links.  This is an incompatible change.
  You can get the old behavior by doing (DELETE-FILE (TRUENAME path)).
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#del-file> for details.

* DRIBBLE now works by redefining *TERMINAL-IO* instead of a host of
  i/o variables.  This allows DRIBBLE to be started and stopped in
  different break loops.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#dribble> for details.

* Weak hash tables can now remove key/value pairs when either or both
  are garbage collected.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#make-hash> for details.

* You can use (SETF WEAK-POINTER-VALUE) to change the object to which
  the given weak pointer point to.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#weak> for details.

* New macro EXT:DEFINE-HASH-TABLE-TEST allows user-defined hash table tests.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#defhash> for details.

* ANSI CL compliance issues:
  + MAPC, MAPCAR, MAPCAN, MAPL, MAPLIST, MAPCON now require their list
    arguments to be proper lists;
  + TAILP uses EQL, not EQ, to compare the sublists;
  + LOOP was fixed in many many ways, including
    - using ATOM as the end test for ON iteration,
    - returning the SUMs (and alike) of the specified type (if any),
    - checking that the THEREIS return value is not shadowed,
    - treating keyword IT in an inappropriate place as a variable,
    - signaling SOURCE-PROGRAM-ERROR errors at macroexpansion time,
    - not requiring the package argument for symbol iteration,
    - making local variables accessible in the INITIALLY clauses,
    - initializing accumulation variables after iteration variables
      to avoid shadowing,
    - using forward consing for APPEND/NCONC because REVAPPEND/NRECONC
      drop the last atom in dotted lists,
    - checking for duplicate variables in iteration clauses;
  + DOCUMENTATION is now a generic function;
  + implemented CHANGE-CLASS, UPDATE-INSTANCE-FOR-DIFFERENT-CLASS,
    MAKE-INSTANCES-OBSOLETE, UPDATE-INSTANCE-FOR-REDEFINED-CLASS, and
    ENSURE-GENERIC-FUNCTION;
  + DEFCLASS no longer requires that direct superclasses already exist;
  + sequence functions (MAP, LENGTH and such) no longer accept dotted lists
    and treat NULL as LIST of length 0 and CONS as LIST of positive length;
  + COERCE accepts CLOS class object as a type-spec (second argument) and
    coerces FLOAT to COMPLEX by returning a COMPLEX number;
  + DEFSTRUCT uses the slot name as is for the accessor when :CONC-NAME
    is NIL (i.e., does not intern the name in *PACKAGE*), and does not
    bind slot names in the arglist of keyword constructors;
  + MAPCAN and MAPCON now correctly handle functions returning ATOMs;
  + removed macro definition from GENERIC-FUNCTION;
  + APPEND, COPY-ALIST, REVAPPEND, NRECONC, PAIRLIS, GET, GETF,
    REMPROP, GET-PROPERTIES no longer accept dotted lists;
  + implemented arrays with ARRAY-ELEMENT-TYPE NIL;
  + implemented ANSI CL Issues <CONDITION-RESTARTS:PERMIT-ASSOCIATION>,
    <DEBUGGER-HOOK-VS-BREAK:CLARIFY>, <DOCUMENTATION-FUNCTION-BUGS:FIX>,
    <EXTERNAL-FORMAT-FOR-EVERY-FILE-CONNECTION:MINIMUM>,
    <IMPORT-SETF-SYMBOL-PACKAGE>, <SETF-FIND-CLASS:ALLOW-NIL>,
    <SUBTYPEP-ENVIRONMENT:ADD-ARG>, <THE-VALUES:RETURN-NUMBER-RECEIVED>,
    <ADJUST-ARRAY-NOT-ADJUSTABLE:IMPLICIT-COPY>;
  + EQUALP on HASH-TABLEs now correctly descends the structure;
  + macro definitions now respect the lexical environment;
  + more thorough lambda list matching check;
  + DEFINE-CONDITION now return the condition name;
  + a character is now accepted as a package designator.
  Thanks to Paul F. Dietz <dietz@dls.net> and his ANSI compliance
  suite, which helped detect some of these deficiencies.

* FUNCTION-LAMBDA-EXPRESSION now always returns the correct function name.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#fle> for details.

* CONSTANTP now detects many more constant forms.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#constantp> for details.

* The code walker has now a public interface: EXT:EXPAND-FORM.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#code-walk> for details.

* Renamed macro SPACE to EXT:TIMES because SPACE is an ANSI Common Lisp
  symbol without a macro definition.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#time> for details.

* New function EXT:XOR checks that exactly one of its arguments is non-NIL.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#xor> for details.

* New function EXT:MAKE-STREAM creates a stream out of a file descriptor
  and facilitates CGI scripting.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#make-stream> and
  <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#bin-stdio> for details.

* New function EXT:MODULE-INFO provides information about the CLISP
  modules that comprise the running image.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#modinfo> for details.

* New generic function CLOS:CLASS-PROTOTYPE from MOP.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#class-proto> for details.

* New generic functions CLOS:CLASS-FINALIZED-P and
  CLOS:FINALIZE-INHERITANCE from MOP.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#def-class> for details.

* New FFI functionality:
  + functions FFI:FOREIGN-ALLOCATE and FFI:FOREIGN-FREE and macros
    FFI:ALLOCATE-DEEP and FFI:ALLOCATE-SHALLOW permit heap allocation;
    see <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#foreign-heap> for details;
  + functions FFI:FOREIGN-ADDRESS-UNSIGNED and FFI:UNSIGNED-FOREIGN-ADDRESS,
    see <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#faddr-u> for details;
  + function FFI:FOREIGN-ADDRESS,
    see <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#faddr> for details;
  + functions FFI:FOREIGN-POINTER and (SETF FFI:FOREIGN-POINTER),
    see <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#fptr> for details;
  + macros FFI:C-VAR-ADDRESS, FFI:C-VAR-OBJECT and FFI:OFFSET,
    see <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#offset> and
    <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#c-var-addr>;
  + function (SETF FFI:VALIDP) invalidates foreign objects
    see <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#validp> for details;
  + macros FFI:WITH-FOREIGN-STRING, and macro FFI:WITH-C-PLACE,
    see <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#foreign-stack-string> and
    <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#with-c-place>.
  Thanks to Jörg Höhle <hoehle@users.sourceforge.net>.
  + FFI:DEF-CALL-OUT and FFI:DEF-C-VAR now accept a :LIBRARY option which
    allows you to specify the dynamic library which contains the object.
    See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#def-call-out> and
    <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#def-c-var>.
  + Introduced a bit of polymorphism: FFI:C-POINTER can be NIL and will
    be treated as NULL; NULL return value of type FFI:C-POINTER is
    returned as NIL.
    See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#c-pointer>.
  + You can now map between numeric and symbolic C enum values using
    functions FFI:ENUM-FROM-VALUE and FFI:ENUM-TO-VALUE.
    See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#def-c-enum>.

* FFI does not output extern variable and function declarations unless
  you set FFI:*OUTPUT-C-VARIABLES* and/or FFI:*OUTPUT-C-FUNCTIONS* to T.
  Please use FFI:C-LINES to include the appropriate headers instead.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#ffi-extern-output> for details.

* Regexp module functions now support more options, e.g., :EXTENDED to
  use extended regular expressions, and do not rely on FFI.
  In particular, REGEXP:REGEXP-COMPILE now accepts keyword and not
  optional arguments (this is not backwards compatible).
  When the system library provides a regexp implementation,
  it is used instead of the GNU regexp distributed with CLISP.
  The number of subexpressions is now unlimited (the limit was 10).
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#regexp> for details.

* Unified modules postgresql632 and postgresql642 into postgresql.
  The postgresql module works with PostgreSQL 6 and 7 now.

* Removed obsolete module linuxlibc5 and renamed module linuxlibc6 to glibc.

* New module: bindings/win32 (highly incomplete, patches are welcome).

* The BACKQUOTE reader has been reimplemented from scratch by
  Kaz Kylheku <kaz@ashi.footprints.net>.

* New function EXT:MAKE-XTERM-IO-STREAM creates an input-output stream
  that uses a separate X terminal.  UNIX platforms only.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#separate-io> for details.

* Fixed a bug in PEEK-CHAR with non-NIL peek-type on ECHO-STREAMS.

* Fixed a bug in FILE-POSITION after UNREAD-CHAR (or PEEK-CHAR).

* Fixed a bug in bit operations on multi-dimensional arrays.

* CLISP/MIT-CLX now compiles CLOCC CLUE/CLIO.
  See <http://clocc.sourceforge.net/clocc/src/gui/clue/> and
  <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#included-modules>.

* CLISP/NEW-CLX on win32 with Cygwin X server compiles garnet.
  See <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.clisp.devel/10093>.

* Command line interface: allow multiple -x options.
  New options -repl <http://clisp.cons.org/clisp.html#opt-repl>
  and -v (--verbose) <http://clisp.cons.org/clisp.html#opt-verbose>.


2.30 (2002-09-15)
=================

User visible changes
--------------------

* CLISP does not come with GNU libiconv anymore.  The most important
  encodings are built-in anyway, and CLISP can use the GNU libc 2.2
  iconv and a GNU libiconv when it is independently installed.

* CLISP does not come with GNU gettext anymore.  This is a separate
  package and should be installed separately, if you wish to use i18n.

* CLISP does not come with GNU readline anymore, because, starting with
  version 4.3, readline supports multibyte characters out of the box.

* CLISP does not come with GNU libsigsegv anymore.  This means that in
  certain cases of infinite recursion, the C stack overflow will not be
  properly detected and will result in a segfault instead of an error.
  You are urged to download and install GNU libsigsegv from
  <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/libsigsegv/> or
  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/libsigsegv/>
  before configuring CLISP.

* Strings can now hold UCS-4 characters, instead of only UCS-2 characters.
  CHAR-CODE-LIMIT increased from 65536 to 1114112.

* Added a new module - "oracle": an interface to the Oracle ODBMS.
  Thanks to John K. Hinsdale <hin@alma.com>.

* New user variable CUSTOM:*PARSE-NAMESTRING-DOT-FILE* controls
  how the file names starting with a dot are parsed.
  By default, it is set to :NAME in config.lisp,
  so #P".clisprc" is now #S(PATHNAME :NAME ".clisprc").
  To get the old result of #S(PATHNAME :TYPE "clisprc"),
  set this variable to :TYPE.
  This is an incompatible change.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#name-type-split> for details.

* New user variable CUSTOM:*TRACE-INDENT* controls TRACE output indentation.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#trace> for details.

* SOCKET:SOCKET-ACCEPT and SOCKET:SOCKET-CONNECT now accept a :TIMEOUT
  keyword argument.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#timeout-k> for details.

* SAVEINITMEM now accepts :START-PACKAGE, :VERBOSE, and :LOCKED-PACKAGES
  keyword arguments.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#image> for details.

* You can now shutdown a socket for input or output separately
  using SOCKET:SOCKET-STREAM-SHUTDOWN.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#sost-shut> for details.

* CUSTOM:*SOURCE-FILE-TYPES* and CUSTOM:*COMPILED-FILE-TYPES*
  now contain strings, not pathnames.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#loadfile> for details.

* EXT:GETENV now returns all of the OS environment as an alist
  when its argument is omitted or NIL.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#getenv> for details.

* When configured with --with-export-syscalls,
  several new functions are available:
   POSIX:STREAM-LOCK provides an interface to flock(2);
   POSIX:COPY-FILE provides an interface to link(2)/symlink(2)/rename(2),
     (in addition to the usual file copy);
   POSIX:DUPLICATE-HANDLE provides an interface to dup(2)/dup2(2).
  Thanks to Marco Baringer for COPY-FILE and DUPLICATE-HANDLE.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#syscalls> for details.

* You can now control the CLISP exit code better by passing a
  non-negative integer to EXT:EXIT.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#quit> for details.

* New macros FFI:WITH-C-VAR and FFI:WITH-FOREIGN-OBJECT allow
  allocating C data on the stack.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#foreign-stack> for details.

* Russian translations of the user interface messages have been added.
  Thanks to Arseny Slobodjuck <ampy@ich.dvo.ru>.

* When built with readline, CLISP will DESCRIBE the current function
  when you hit TAB after a #\Space.

* MAKE-ENCODING now checks whether the iconv charset is valid, and
  signals an error if it is invalid unless given the :IF-DOES-NOT-EXIST
  NIL argument.

* New debugger command Quit (:q) aborts to the top-level read-eval-print
  loop immediately, saving you typing :a several times.

* When CUSTOM:*PARSE-NAMESTRING-ANSI* is non-NIL, do not accept symbols
  as pathname designators.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#filename-dict> for details.

* COMPILE-FILE no longer clobbers an existing *.c file when the Lisp
  file being compiled does not contain any FFI forms.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#compilefile> for details.

* Type COMPLEX now correctly uses UPGRADED-COMPLEX-PART-TYPE.

* Improved accuracy of some transcendental functions, e.g., now
  (EXPT -5.0 2.0) return #C(25.0 0.0).

* Fixed a bug: Conversion from bytes to string did not work for the encoding
  (MAKE-ENCODING :CHARSET CHARSET:UNICODE-32-LITTLE-ENDIAN
                 :INPUT-ERROR-ACTION :IGNORE).

* Fixed a bug in compiling duplicate keyword arguments.

* Fixed the (destructuring-bind (&key (x x)) ...) bug.

* Wide-mode -W backward compatibility option is now gone
  (defunct since 1998-09-09).  This permits colons in memory image file
  names (necessary on Cygwin).

* CLISP on Cygwin now understands native pathnames like "c:/gnu/clisp/"
  by translating them internally to "/cygdrive/c/gnu/clisp/".
  CLISP on Win32 now understands Cygwin pathnames like "/cygdrive/c/gnu/clisp/"
  by translating them internally to "c:/gnu/clisp/".
  You can disable this by setting CUSTOM:*DEVICE-PREFIX* to NIL.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#device-prefix> for details.

* Readline is now used properly on Cygwin.

* DIR-KEY now works on Cygwin.

Portability
-----------

* CLISP now works on SPARC/Linux with glibc 2.2 when built with SAFETY=3.


2.29 (2002-07-25)
=================

User visible changes [this is a bug-fix/portability release]
--------------------

* INSPECT: fixed bugs in HTML generation, Content-Length header,
  removing incorrect package on exit, help in nested inspect sessions.

* COMPILE-FILE: fixed :VERBOSE NIL handling.

* DESCRIBE: handles DIR-KEY now.

* (LAMBDA () (DEFMETHOD ...)) now works.

* Fixed RETURN-FROM in deep nesting.

* Fixed crash on errors in module initialization.

* COMPILER-MACROs can now expand to special forms.

* EVAL-WHEN now distinguishes between COMPILE and :COMPILE-TOPLEVEL
  and between LOAD and :LOAD-TOLEVEL.

Portability
-----------

* CLISP now builds with GCC-3.1 out of the box.


2.28 (2002-03-03)
=================

Important notes
---------------

* All .fas files generated by previous CLISP versions
  are invalid and must be recompiled.

User visible changes
--------------------

* ANSI CL functions MAKE-LOAD-FORM and MAKE-LOAD-FORM-SAVING-SLOTS
  are implemented.

* ANSI CL pretty printer <http://www.lisp.org/HyperSpec/Body/sec_22-2.html>
  is implemented.
  In particular,
    variables     *PRINT-LINES*, *PRINT-MISER-WIDTH*, *PRINT-PPRINT-DISPATCH*,
    macro         PPRINT-LOGICAL-BLOCK,
    local macros  PPRINT-EXIT-IF-LIST-EXHAUSTED, PPRINT-POP
    and functions PPRINT-DISPATCH, COPY-PPRINT-DISPATCH, SET-PPRINT-DISPATCH,
                  PPRINT-FILL, PPRINT-LINEAR, PPRINT-TABULAR, PPRINT-TAB,
                  PPRINT-NEWLINE, PPRINT-INDENT
  are implemented.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#clpp> for details.

* The functions WRITE and WRITE-TO-STRING now accept :LINES, :MISER-WIDTH
  and :PRINT-PPRINT-DISPATCH keyword arguments.
  This change requires recompilation of all .fas files.

* Weak hash-tables are now supported.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#make-hash> for details.

* Support Cygwin's "/cygdrive/drive/path" pathname syntax on Win32.

* New macro EXT:FCASE which allows specifying comparison function in CASE.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#fcase> for details.

2.27 (2001-07-17)
=================

User visible changes
--------------------

* EXT:GETENV is now setfable.

* Hostname resolution is now optional in
  EXT:SOCKET-STREAM-PEER and EXT:SOCKET-STREAM-LOCAL.

* EXT:SOCKET-STATUS now accepts SOCKET-SERVERs too
  and the direction of the checks can be specified.

* Added install.bat for win32 installation.

* ANSI CL compliance: more conformant pathname handling.

* Speed up MEMBER &co when :TEST is EQ, EQL or EQUAL.

* Optimize away local functions that are not used
  (much less consing in CLOS).

* When built with readline, CLISP allows multi-line form editing.
  Use M-p and M-n to move between virtual lines.

* Fixed handling of circular structs and pointers to functions in the FFI.

* Fixed binary I/O for streams with element type longer than one byte,
  but not a whole number of bytes.


2.26 (2001-05-23)
=================

Important notes
---------------

* The CLISP extensions have been moved from the CLtL1 package LISP to
  separate packages.
  If you rely on any of the CLISP extensions, you will need to make
  your packages use package EXT, which re-exports all exported symbols
  from all extension packages.

* All .fas files generated by previous CLISP versions
  are invalid and must be recompiled.

User visible changes
--------------------

* "LISP" is now a nickname of the ANSI CL package COMMON-LISP.
  "USER" is now a nickname of the ANSI CL package COMMON-LISP-USER.
  Support for CLtL1 has thus been removed.
  For the benefit of package developers, *FEATURES* now contains :LISP=CL.

* The *FEATURES* list now contains :ANSI-CL instead of :CLTL2 even when
  running without '-ansi' ANSI compatibility mode.

* ANSI CL compliance: function UPGRADED-COMPLEX-PART-TYPE implemented.

* ANSI CL compliance: macro HANDLER-BIND invokes all handlers
  for the condition, not just the first one.

* ANSI CL compliance: CHAR does not check for FILL-POINTER, while ELT does.

* ANSI CL compliance: FUNCTION-KEYWORDS returns 2 values.

* ANSI CL compliance: COMPILED-FUNCTION is a subtype of FUNCTION.

* ANSI CL compliance: implemented compiler macros.

* Conforming to the ANSI CL issue CONSTANTP-ENVIRONMENT:ADD-ARG,
  CONSTANTP now takes an optional second argument.

* RUN-SHELL-COMMAND and RUN-PROGRAM now accept a :WAIT argument.

* The compiler now checks the signature of function calls
  for all functions, not just the inlined built-ins.


2.25.1 (2001-04-06)
===================

User visible changes [this is a bug-fix only release]
--------------------

* ANSI CL compliance: INITIALIZE-INSTANCE accepts &KEY &ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS
  arguments.

* Fixed a bug: a single value was sometimes returned by READ-LINE.

* Fixed a bug: re-exporting inherited symbols resulted in them being
  reported as both external and inherited by WITH-PACKAGE-ITERATOR.

* Fixed a bug: the full image and other images created with clisp-link
  exited on error instead of entering the debugger.

* Fixed a bug: COMPILE-FILE-PATHNAME could return bad results when given a
  non-existent INPUT-FILE argument and an OUTPUT-FILE argument with
  non-NIL directory part.

* Fixed --without-unicode build.


2.25 (2001-03-15)
=================

Important notes
---------------

* The default extension of Lisp source files for CLISP is now ".lisp" instead
  of ".lsp". When both "foo.lisp" and "foo.lsp" exist, (LOAD "foo") will load
  "foo.lisp".

* Changed bytecode format. All .fas files generated by previous CLISP versions
  are invalid and must be recompiled.

User visible changes
--------------------

* A new version numbering scheme is adopted.

* If an error is signalled by a form supplied with the command-line
  option "-x", CLISP now exits with a non-zero status.

* The pretty-printer does not print hanging parenthesis by default now.
  *PRINT-RPARS* now defaults to NIL and *PRINT-INDENT-LISTS* to 1, so
  that the lists are printed like in CLHS and CLtL.

* New extension: directory access (win32 registry).
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#dir-key> for details.

* Support UNC pathnames (\\host\dir\name.ext) on win32.

* Support the SCREEN package on Win32. Thanks to Arseny Slobodjuck.

* New functions CONVERT-STRING-FROM-BYTES and CONVERT-STRING-TO-BYTES.

* Support for non-blocking binary I/O.
  New functions READ-BYTE-LOOKAHEAD, READ-BYTE-WILL-HANG-P, READ-BYTE-NO-HANG.
  New generic functions STREAM-READ-BYTE-LOOKAHEAD,
  STREAM-READ-BYTE-WILL-HANG-P, STREAM-READ-BYTE-NO-HANG.

* CONCATENATED-STREAM-STREAMS now returns only the remaining streams,
  as per ANSI CL spec.

* Implemented ANSI CL function INSPECT,
  and a function LISP:CLHS for access of Common Lisp HyperSpec.

* Characters have now the same names as in Unicode 3.0, with space replaced
  by underscore.

* ANSI CL compliance: CALL-NEXT-METHOD and NEXT-METHOD-P are now implemented
  as local functions, not local macros. It is now possible to call
  (APPLY #'CALL-NEXT-METHOD argument-list-of-unknown-length).

* ANSI CL compliance: LOAD has a new keyword argument :EXTERNAL-FORMAT.

* ANSI CL compliance: When an end-of-stream occurs, READ, READ-CHAR, PEEK-CHAR,
  READ-CHAR-NO-HANG, READ-LINE, READ-BYTE, READ-INTEGER, READ-FLOAT, called
  with arguments eof-error-p = NIL and without eof-value, now return NIL
  instead of #<END OF FILE>.

* ANSI CL compliance: When LISP:*PARSE-NAMESTRING-ANSI* is non-NIL,
  PARSE-NAMESTRING parses strings with colons as logical pathnames.

* New supported character sets in package CHARSET: GB18030, BIG5HKSCS.

* Arguments passed to MAKE-PATHNAME with value NIL are not overridden by
  pathname slots in the :DEFAULTS argument any more.

* STREAM-ELEMENT-TYPE of a TWO-WAY-STREAM or an ECHO-STREAM now depends on
  the stream's constituents. Previously, it was always (OR CHARACTER INTEGER).

* Fixed a bug: REPLACE signalled an error if the source and destination
  sequences were the same and the source and destination ranges did not
  overlap.

* Fixed a bug: A garbage collection during the execution of a foreign function
  callback caused a crash.

* Fixed a bug: Calling READ-LINE on a stream already positioned at EOF caused
  a crash on 64-bit platforms.

* Fixed a bug: For long-floats, (EQL x (- x)) returned true.

* Fixed a bug: OPEN now returns NIL when the filename's directory does not
  exist and :IF-DOES-NOT-EXIST NIL was specified. Previously, an error was
  signalled except when :DIRECTION was :PROBE.

* Fixed a bug: (subtypep 'fundamental-stream 'stream) returned NIL.

Portability
-----------

* Added support for IA-64 running Linux.

* Added support for BeOS 5. Thanks to Alexis Rivera Rios <ahrivera@yahoo.com>.

* Removed support for DOS. Not to worry, OS/2 and Win32 are still supported.


2000-03-06
==========

User visible changes
--------------------

* New functions READ-FLOAT and WRITE-FLOAT.

* Implemented ANSI CL macro WITH-COMPILATION-UNIT.

* Unicode support: The pretty-printer and FORMAT ~T now handle non-spacing and
  double-width Unicode characters correctly. Pretty-printer slows down by 30%.
  New functions CHAR-WIDTH, STRING-WIDTH.

* Fixed two bugs in TRANSLATE-PATHNAME: Substitution of "**" did not work.
  Substitutions without version into non-logical pathnames crashed.

* Dutch translations of the user interface messages have been added
  Thanks to Tijs van Bakel <smoke@casema.net>.

* When configured with --with-export-syscalls, :SYSCALLS is in *FEATURES*
  and functions POSIX:RESOLVE-IP-ADDR, POSIX:USER-DATA, POSIX:FILE-STAT,
  POSIX:SYSINFO, POSIX:RESOURCE-USAGE-LIMITS,
  as well as those libm.so functions which do not have a better
  counterpart in ANSI CL are available.

* New supported character sets in package CHARSET: ISO-8859-16, KOI8-U,
  KOI8-RU, EUC-JP, SHIFT-JIS, CP932, ISO-2022-JP, ISO-2022-JP-2, ISO-2022-JP-1,
  EUC-CN, HZ, GBK, CP936, EUC-TW, BIG5, CP950, ISO-2022-CN, ISO-2022-CN-EXT,
  EUC-KR, CP949, ISO-2022-KR, ARMSCII-8, GEORGIAN-ACADEMY, GEORGIAN-PS,
  TIS-620, MULELAO-1, CP1133, VISCII, TCVN, UTF-16, UTF-7, MACINTOSH (as an
  alias for MAC-ROMAN).

Other modifications
-------------------

* Speed up some sequence functions when operating on vectors: MAKE-SEQUENCE,
  CONCATENATE, COPY-SEQ, COERCE, SUBSEQ, REPLACE, FILL, REVERSE, NREVERSE,
  REMOVE[-IF[-NOT]] with :START/:END, SUBSTITUTE[-IF[-NOT]] with :START/:END,
  SORT.

* Speed up ADJUST-ARRAY.


1999-07-22
==========

User visible changes
--------------------

* Added a new module - "postgresql": interface to the PostgreSQL ODBMS.

* Implemented ANSI CL macro WITH-PACKAGE-ITERATOR.

* Conforming to ANSI CL issue <ALLOCATE-INSTANCE:ADD>: New function
  ALLOCATE-INSTANCE.

* Conforming to ANSI CL issue <GENERIC-FLET-POORLY-DESIGNED:DELETE>: The
  symbols GENERIC-FLET and GENERIC-LABELS are not exported from the
  COMMON-LISP package any more.

* Conforming to ANSI CL issues <KEYWORD-ARGUMENT-NAME-PACKAGE:ANY> and
  <MULTIPLE-VALUE-SETQ-ORDER:LIKE-SETF-OF-VALUES>.

* Conforming to ANSI CL Issue <MACRO-FUNCTION-ENVIRONMENT:YES>
  MACRO-FUNCTION now takes an optional second argument ENV.

* When CLISP is invoked with an "-a" option, *features* contain :ANSI-CL.

* Weak pointers are implemented. New functions MAKE-WEAK-POINTER,
  WEAK-POINTER-P, WEAK-POINTER-VALUE.

* The function OPEN, when creating unbuffered file streams, now supports any
  of the following :ELEMENT-TYPEs: CHARACTER and ([UN]SIGNED-BYTE n), where n
  is a multiple of 8.

* The functions
    MAKE-PIPE-INPUT-STREAM, MAKE-PIPE-OUTPUT-STREAM, MAKE-PIPE-IO-STREAM,
    SOCKET-ACCEPT, SOCKET-CONNECT
  accept a keyword argument :ELEMENT-TYPE. Possible values are types
  equivalent to CHARACTER or (UNSIGNED-BYTE n), (SIGNED-BYTE n), where n is
  a positive multiple of 8. Previously these functions returned streams whose
  element-type was (OR CHARACTER (UNSIGNED-BYTE 8)).

* STREAM-ELEMENT-TYPE is SETFable. The element type of streams created by the
  functions MAKE-PIPE-INPUT-STREAM, MAKE-PIPE-OUTPUT-STREAM,
  MAKE-PIPE-IO-STREAM, SOCKET-ACCEPT, SOCKET-CONNECT can be modified, if the
  old and the new element type are compatible.
  (UNSIGNED-BYTE n) and (SIGNED-BYTE n) are compatible, and CHARACTER is
  compatible with ([UN]SIGNED-BYTE 8).

* Character I/O can now be customized via encodings. A stream's external
  format is an encoding, and the symbol macros
    *DEFAULT-FILE-ENCODING*, *PATHNAME-ENCODING*, *TERMINAL-ENCODING*,
    *MISC-ENCODING*, FFI:*FOREIGN-ENCODING*, AFFI:*FOREIGN-ENCODING*
  contain user-settable encodings.
  Encodings can be obtained through the function MAKE-ENCODING, and as values
  of the constants
    CHARSET:UCS-2, CHARSET:UNICODE-16, CHARSET:UNICODE-16-BIG-ENDIAN,
    CHARSET:UNICODE-16-LITTLE-ENDIAN, CHARSET:UCS-4, CHARSET:UNICODE-32,
    CHARSET:UNICODE-32-BIG-ENDIAN, CHARSET:UNICODE-32-LITTLE-ENDIAN,

    CHARSET:CP437, CHARSET:CP737, CHARSET:CP775, CHARSET:CP850, CHARSET:CP852,
    CHARSET:CP855, CHARSET:CP857, CHARSET:CP860, CHARSET:CP861, CHARSET:CP862,
    CHARSET:CP863, CHARSET:CP864, CHARSET:CP865, CHARSET:CP866, CHARSET:CP869,
    CHARSET:CP874, CHARSET:WINDOWS-1250, CHARSET:WINDOWS-1251,
    CHARSET:WINDOWS-1252, CHARSET:WINDOWS-1253, CHARSET:WINDOWS-1254,
    CHARSET:WINDOWS-1255, CHARSET:WINDOWS-1256, CHARSET:WINDOWS-1257,
    CHARSET:WINDOWS-1258, CHARSET:HP-ROMAN8, CHARSET:NEXTSTEP.

* The functions
    OPEN, MAKE-PIPE-INPUT-STREAM, MAKE-PIPE-OUTPUT-STREAM, MAKE-PIPE-IO-STREAM,
    SOCKET-ACCEPT, SOCKET-CONNECT
  and the macro
    WITH-OUTPUT-TO-PRINTER
  accept a keyword argument :EXTERNAL-FORMAT. Possible values are encodings,
  such as returned by the function MAKE-ENCODING, the line terminator keywords
  :UNIX, :MAC, :DOS, and :DEFAULT. New function STREAM-EXTERNAL-FORMAT.

* STREAM-EXTERNAL-FORMAT is SETFable. The external format of streams created
  by the functions OPEN, MAKE-PIPE-INPUT-STREAM, MAKE-PIPE-OUTPUT-STREAM,
  MAKE-PIPE-IO-STREAM, SOCKET-ACCEPT, SOCKET-CONNECT can be modified.

* OPEN has a new keyword argument :BUFFERED. It determines whether the file
  stream returned is buffered or not. Possible values for it are NIL, T, or
  :DEFAULT. If it is :DEFAULT, buffered file streams will be returned for
  regular files and (on Unix) block-devices, and unbuffered file streams for
  special files.

* The functions MAKE-PIPE-INPUT-STREAM, MAKE-PIPE-OUTPUT-STREAM,
  MAKE-PIPE-IO-STREAM, SOCKET-ACCEPT, SOCKET-CONNECT have a new keyword
  argument :BUFFERED. It determines whether the stream returned is buffered or
  not. Possible values for it are NIL, T, or :DEFAULT. :DEFAULT is equivalent
  to NIL.

* New functions READ-INTEGER, WRITE-INTEGER which can be used to do binary I/O
  on streams with element-type (UNSIGNED-BYTE 8).

* The Gray proposal <STREAM-DEFINITION-BY-USER> is implemented:
  New classes
    FUNDAMENTAL-STREAM,
    FUNDAMENTAL-INPUT-STREAM, FUNDAMENTAL-OUTPUT-STREAM,
    FUNDAMENTAL-CHARACTER-STREAM, FUNDAMENTAL-BINARY-STREAM,
    FUNDAMENTAL-CHARACTER-INPUT-STREAM, FUNDAMENTAL-CHARACTER-OUTPUT-STREAM,
    FUNDAMENTAL-BINARY-INPUT-STREAM, FUNDAMENTAL-BINARY-OUTPUT-STREAM.
  New generic functions
    STREAM-READ-CHAR, STREAM-UNREAD-CHAR, STREAM-READ-CHAR-NO-HANG,
    STREAM-PEEK-CHAR, STREAM-LISTEN, STREAM-READ-CHAR-WILL-HANG-P,
    STREAM-READ-CHAR-SEQUENCE, STREAM-READ-LINE, STREAM-CLEAR-INPUT,
    STREAM-WRITE-CHAR, STREAM-LINE-COLUMN, STREAM-START-LINE-P,
    STREAM-WRITE-CHAR-SEQUENCE, STREAM-WRITE-STRING, STREAM-TERPRI,
    STREAM-FRESH-LINE, STREAM-FINISH-OUTPUT, STREAM-FORCE-OUTPUT,
    STREAM-CLEAR-OUTPUT, STREAM-ADVANCE-TO-COLUMN,
    STREAM-READ-BYTE, STREAM-READ-BYTE-SEQUENCE,
    STREAM-WRITE-BYTE, STREAM-WRITE-BYTE-SEQUENCE.
  The functions CLOSE, OPEN-STREAM-P, STREAM-ELEMENT-TYPE are now generic
  functions.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#gray> for details.

* The macros FFI:DEF-C-CALL-OUT and FFI:DEF-C-CALL-IN now add an argument
  :LANGUAGE :STDC (means ANSI C) instead of :LANGUAGE :C (means old K&R C).

* Conforming with ANSI CL, SIMPLE-CONDITION now has the initarg
  :FORMAT-CONTROL instead of :FORMAT-STRING. New function
  SIMPLE-CONDITION-FORMAT-CONTROL.

* Conforming with ANSI CL, FILE-LENGTH and FILE-POSITION, when called on
  an unbuffered file stream, now return NIL instead of signaling an error.

* Conforming with ANSI CL, MACROEXPAND and MACROEXPAND-1 now accept NIL as
  second argument, denoting the global environment.

* Conforming with ANSI CL, the reader now signals an error of type
  READER-ERROR when trying to parse tokens like 35/000 or 1.5e1000,
  instead of DIVISION-BY-ZERO and FLOATING-POINT-OVERFLOW, respectively.

* On Unix, calling OPEN on a block device now returns a buffered stream
  instead of an unbuffered stream.

* On Unix, writing to a pipe created by MAKE-PIPE-OUTPUT-STREAM or
  MAKE-PIPE-IO-STREAM after the corresponding child process has exited
  now leads to an error message instead of terminating the CLISP process.

* The generic function GENERIC-STREAM-LISTEN is replaced with
  GENERIC-STREAM-READ-CHAR-WILL-HANG-P.

* The function XGCD now really always returns coefficients of smallest
  possible absolute value.

* Fixed a interpreter bug: (let (x) (declare (special x)) ...) did not change
  the global value of x in interpreted mode.

* Fixed a bug: On Win32, Ctrl-Z sometimes caused two levels of the read-eval-
  print loop to be aborted instead of just one.

* Fixed a bug: READ-CHAR-SEQUENCE, when called on a string input stream,
  forgot to advance the pointer into the string.

* Fixed a bug: WRITE-CHAR-SEQUENCE on Win32 failed to convert NL to CR/LF.

* Fixed a bug: Calling (GET-DISPATCH-MACRO-CHARACTER disp-char sub-char) would
  crash, instead of returning NIL, if there is no macro-character function
  associated with sub-char after disp-char.

* Fixed a bug: (CHECK-TYPE place typespec string) did not evaluate `string'.

* Fixed a bug: Calling the function FINALIZE caused a crash during the next GC
  on many platforms.

* Fixed a bug: Calling a generic function without any installed method
  resulted in an inappropriate error message, not a call to
  NO-APPLICABLE-METHOD.

* Fixed a bug: Closing a SOCKET-SERVER twice, or using a closed SOCKET-SERVER
  could result in inappropriate error messages.

* Fixed a bug: (format nil "~@D" 0) ==> "+0" now.

Portability
-----------

* Added support for SPARC running Linux.

* Added support for Apple PowerPC running MacOS X Server (a.k.a. Rhapsody).

* Improved support for m68k running Linux.

* Added build instructions for Win32 using MSVC 6.0.

Other modifications
-------------------

* On Linux 2.2.x with glibc-2.1, Solaris, OSF/1 and Irix, stack overflow is
  now caught reliably. Previously, endless recursion in interpreted code could
  cause a crash in some cases.

* Speed up the function DIRECTORY on Unix in some cases.

* Speed up compiled calls to LDB, LDB-TEST, MASK-FIELD, DPB, DEPOSIT-FIELD.


1999-01-08
==========

Important note
--------------

* Changed bytecode format. All .fas files generated by previous CLISP versions
  are invalid and must be recompiled.

User visible changes
--------------------

* Conforming to ANSI CL issue <SETF-MULTIPLE-STORE-VARIABLES:ALLOW>:
  multiple values in ASSERT, ROTATEF, SHIFTF &c.

* Conforming to ANSI CL issue <SETF-OF-VALUES:ADD>: `values' can take
  multiple value places in setf &c.

* The variable `*prompt-with-package*' is replaced with `*prompt*',
  which can be a function.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#prompt> for details.

* Conforming with X3J13 writeup <FUNCTION-TYPE:X3J13-MARCH-88>, an error
  is now signalled when a lambda expression (not a function) is passed to
  APPLY, FUNCALL, SETF SYMBOL-FUNCTION, EVERY, SOME, NOTEVERY, NOTANY,
  SET-MACRO-CHARACTER, SET-DISPATCH-MACRO-CHARACTER. The latter two now
  accept a symbol instead of a function.

* X3J13 vote <103> = writeup <IN-PACKAGE-FUNCTIONALITY:MAR89-X3J13> is
  implemented: COMMON-LISP:IN-PACKAGE is now a macro. LISP:IN-PACKAGE retains
  the old semantics as a function.
  The syntaxes (IN-PACKAGE "FOO") and (IN-PACKAGE :FOO) work with both
  variations.

* X3J13 vote <11> = writeups <CHARACTER-PROPOSAL:2>,
  <CHARACTER-LOOSE-ENDS:FIX>, <CHARACTER-VS-CHAR:LESS-INCONSISTENT-SHORT>,
  <JUN90-TRIVIAL-ISSUES:24>, <STANDARD-REPERTOIRE-GRATUITOUS:RENAME> are
  implemented: Characters do not have font and bits attributes any more.
  The following symbols are not exported from package COMMON-LISP any more:
     STRING-CHAR STRING-CHAR-P
     CHAR-FONT-LIMIT CHAR-BITS-LIMIT
     CHAR-CONTROL-BIT CHAR-META-BIT CHAR-SUPER-BIT CHAR-HYPER-BIT
     CHAR-BITS CHAR-FONT MAKE-CHAR INT-CHAR CHAR-BIT SET-CHAR-BIT
  MAKE-STRING and MAKE-STRING-OUTPUT-STREAM have a new keyword argument
  :ELEMENT-TYPE.
  New types BASE-CHAR, EXTENDED-CHAR, BASE-STRING, SIMPLE-BASE-STRING.

* X3J13 writeup <SETF-METHOD-VS-SETF-METHOD:RENAME-OLD-TERMS> is implemented:
  New function GET-SETF-EXPANSION, new macro DEFINE-SETF-EXPANDER. The old
  symbols GET-SETF-METHOD-MULTIPLE-VALUE, GET-SETF-METHOD, DEFINE-SETF-METHOD
  are removed from package COMMON-LISP.

* X3J13 writeups <READER-ERROR:NEW-TYPE> and <PARSE-ERROR-STREAM:SPLIT-TYPES>
  are implemented: New condition classes PARSE-ERROR and READER-ERROR.

* X3J13 writeup <UNDEFINED-VARIABLES-AND-FUNCTIONS:COMPROMISE> is implemented:
  New condition class UNBOUND-SLOT. New function UNBOUND-SLOT-INSTANCE.

* X3J13 writeups <COMMON-TYPE:REMOVE> and <COMPILER-LET-CONFUSION:ELIMINATE>
  are implemented: COMMONP and COMPILER-LET are not exported from package
  COMMON-LISP any more.

* X3J13 vote <138> = writeup <PEEK-CHAR-READ-CHAR-ECHO:FIRST-READ-CHAR> is
  implemented: PEEK-CHAR does less side effects than READ-CHAR followed by
  UNREAD-CHAR would do.

* X3J13 writeup <SHARPSIGN-PLUS-MINUS-PACKAGE:KEYWORD> is implemented:
  When looking up a feature symbol in *FEATURES*, the package is no longer
  ignored. All initial elements of *FEATURES* are now keywords. The reader
  binds *PACKAGE* to #<PACKAGE KEYWORD> during #+ and #-.

* X3J13 writeup <SLOT-MISSING-VALUES:SPECIFY> is implemented: Some of the
  values of SLOT-MISSING are ignored, depending on context.

* X3J13 writeup <WITH-OPEN-FILE-SETQ:EXPLICITLY-VAGUE> is implemented:
  Assigning the variable bound by the WITH-INPUT-FROM-STRING, WITH-OPEN-FILE,
  WITH-OPEN-STREAM, WITH-OUTPUT-TO-STRING macros generates a compiler warning.

* X3J13 writeup <SEQUENCE-TYPE-LENGTH:MUST-MATCH> is implemented: The
  functions MAKE-SEQUENCE, COERCE, CONCATENATE, MAP, MERGE signal an error
  if the result type specifies a length inconsistent with the other arguments.

* X3J13 writeup <SYMBOL-MACROS-AND-PROCLAIMED-SPECIALS:SIGNALS-AN-ERROR> is
  implemented: SYMBOL-MACROLET of special variables or constants now signals
  an error.

* Conforming with X3J13 writeup <DOTTED-LIST-ARGUMENTS:CLARIFY>, the first
  argument of LDIFF may now be a dotted list.

* PATHNAME-MATCH-P and TRANSLATE-PATHNAME now treat missing pathname
  components the same as wild ones.

* Renamed function SOCKET-STREAM-PEER-HOST to SOCKET-STREAM-PEER. New
  functions SOCKET-STREAM-LOCAL and SOCKET-SERVER-HOST.

* Conforming to ANSI CL, DEFSTRUCT with option :INCLUDE now does not define
  accessors which were already defined in a superclass DEFSTRUCT. This solves
  the problems that occur when using the same :CONC-NAME for the new and the
  inherited structure, without need for the DEFSTRUCT option :INHERIT.

* The functions MAKE-BROADCAST-STREAM, MAKE-CONCATENATED-STREAM,
  MAKE-TWO-WAY-STREAM, MAKE-ECHO-STREAM now verify that their arguments are
  input streams or output streams, respectively.

* The function EQUALP now ignores the element type of arrays and looks only
  at the array contents, as specified by ANSI CL.

* The *FEATURES* list now contains the symbol CLTL2 instead of the symbol
  CLTL1.

* The limit for file size of files that can be accessed by CLISP is increased:
  4 GB for character streams, 512 MB for integer streams. The previous limits
  were 16 MB for character streams, 2 MB for integer streams.

* Fixed a bug: Calling the function INTERACTIVE-STREAM-P with a non-stream
  argument could cause a crash.

* Fixed a bug in the LOOP macro: OF-TYPE was not supported in numeric
  accumulation clauses (COUNT/SUM/MAXIMIZE/MINIMIZE).

* Fixed a bug in the LOOP macro: The FOR clauses FROM/TO/BY can now be given
  in any order.

* Fixed a bug: (UPGRADED-ARRAY-ELEMENT-TYPE 'STANDARD-CHAR) returned T instead
  of STRING-CHAR.

* Fixed a bug: The function CERROR signalled an error if more than two
  arguments were given and the second argument was a condition.

* Fixed a bug: Hash tables with test #'EQUALP did not work correctly when the
  keys are characters, multi-dimensional arrays or pathnames.

* The function VALUES-LIST now verifies that its argument is a proper list.

* The function XGCD now in most cases (but not always) returns coefficients of
  smallest possible absolute value. Suggested by the LiDIA group.

Other modifications
-------------------


9 September 1998
================

Important note
--------------

* Changed bytecode format. All .fas files generated by previous CLISP versions
  are invalid and must be recompiled.

User visible changes
--------------------

* The 16 MB memory size limit on 32-bit machines is gone. No need for
  wide-mode binaries any more. The "makemake" option --with-wide is not
  supported any more. The command-line option -W is supported for backward
  compatibility, but will be removed in the future.

* New variables *WARN-ON-FLOATING-POINT-CONTAGION* and
  *FLOATING-POINT-CONTAGION-ANSI*.

* New function PROBE-DIRECTORY which tests for the existence of a directory.
  Suggested by many people.

* New FORMAT directives ~/ (ANSI standard) and ~! (a better alternative).

* ANSI CL variable *PRINT-RIGHT-MARGIN* is implemented.

* The functions WRITE and WRITE-TO-STRING take the :RIGHT-MARGIN key argument.

* X3J13 writeup <TYPE-BOOLEAN> is implemented: New type BOOLEAN.
  Suggested by Sam Steingold.

* X3J13 writeup <ARGUMENT-MISMATCH-ERROR-MOON:FIX> is implemented:
  Errors during function calls (too few arguments, too many arguments,
  invalid keyword arguments, odd number of keyword arguments, unrecognized
  keyword arguments) are now of type PROGRAM-ERROR.

* X3J13 writeup <ENSURE-DIRECTORIES-EXIST> is implemented:
  New function ENSURE-DIRECTORIES-EXIST.
  Suggested by Pierpaolo Bernardi.

* X3J13 writeup <ISO-COMPATIBILITY:ADD-SUBSTRATE> is implemented:
  The macro DEFINE-SYMBOL-MACRO is now exported from package COMMON-LISP.
  Suggested by Pierpaolo Bernardi.

* X3J13 writeup <DISPLACED-ARRAY-PREDICATE> is implemented:
  New function ARRAY-DISPLACEMENT.

* X3J13 writeup <CLASS-OBJECT-SPECIALIZER:AFFIRM> is implemented:
  Class objects can now be used as parameter specializer names (not only
  symbols and lists of the form (EQL object)).

* X3J13 writeup <COMPILE-FILE-OUTPUT-FILE-DEFAULTS:INPUT-FILE> is implemented:
  When :OUTPUT-FILE is given to COMPILE-FILE or COMPILE-FILE-PATHNAME, missing
  pathname components are merged in from the input file pathname.

* X3J13 writeup <COMPILE-FILE-PATHNAME-ARGUMENTS:MAKE-CONSISTENT> is
  implemented: COMPILE-FILE-PATHNAME accepts any keyword arguments.

* X3J13 writeup <COMPUTE-APPLICABLE-METHODS:GENERIC> is implemented:
  COMPUTE-APPLICABLE-METHODS is now a generic function.

* X3J13 writeup <CONDITION-SLOTS:HIDDEN> is implemented: Predefined condition
  types have their own private slot names.

* X3J13 vote <57> = writeup <DEFSTRUCT-SLOTS-CONSTRAINTS-NAME:DUPLICATES-ERROR>
  is implemented: Different slots in a structure cannot have names whose
  SYMBOL-NAME are equal.

* X3J13 writeup <CONS-TYPE-SPECIFIER:ADD> is implemented:
  New type specifier (CONS car-type cdr-type).

* X3J13 writeup <DEFMACRO-BLOCK-SCOPE:EXCLUDES-BINDINGS> is implemented:
  The implicit BLOCK generated by DEFMACRO and DEFTYPE encloses only the
  body forms, not the forms occurring in the lambda list.

* X3J13 writeup <DEFSTRUCT-COPIER:ARGUMENT-TYPE> is implemented:
  New function COPY-STRUCTURE.

* X3J13 writeup <JUN90-TRIVIAL-ISSUES:9> is implemented:
  New classes GENERIC-FUNCTION, STRUCTURE-OBJECT, CLASS, METHOD. Removed
  the type STRUCTURE.

* X3J13 writeup <EVALHOOK-STEP-CONFUSION:X3J13-NOV-89> is implemented:
  Do not export EVALHOOK, APPLYHOOK, *EVALHOOK*, *APPLYHOOK* from package
  COMMON-LISP any more.

* X3J13 writeup <MACRO-DECLARATIONS:MAKE-EXPLICIT> is implemented: NOTINLINE
  declarations of macros having special compiler treatment are now respected.

* X3J13 writeups <DEFSTRUCT-PRINT-FUNCTION-INHERITANCE:YES> and
  <DEFSTRUCT-PRINT-FUNCTION-AGAIN:X3J13-MAR-93> are implemented:
  DEFSTRUCT accepts an option :PRINT-OBJECT, similar to :PRINT-FUNCTION,
  and each of these options causes a method on PRINT-OBJECT to be installed.

* X3J13 writeup <SPECIAL-FORM-P-MISNOMER:RENAME> is implemented: New function
  SPECIAL-OPERATOR-P. The function SPECIAL-FORM-P still exists, but its use
  generates a compiler warning.

* X3J13 writeup <FLOATING-POINT-CONDITION-NAMES:X3J13-NOV-89> is implemented:
  New condition types FLOATING-POINT-INEXACT, FLOATING-POINT-INVALID-OPERATION.

* Fixed a bug: Reading objects in #n# syntax into typed structure slots gave
  an error if the structure's constructor was not compiled.
  Reported by Sam Steingold.

* BUTLAST and NBUTLAST are now ANSI CL compliant: They signal an error if the
  argument is a dotted list of length 0. (Stupid.)

* The macro WITH-OUTPUT-TO-STRING is now ANSI compliant.

* Added FFI support for NetBSD/m68k.
  Thanks to Jörn Clausen <joern@techfak.uni-bielefeld.de>.

* Use of the deprecated functions GENTEMP and SET now generates a compiler
  warning.

* Stricter syntax checking for DO and DO*.

* When CLOS:CALL-NEXT-METHOD is called with arguments, it is now checked that
  the set of applicable methods is the same as for the original arguments, in
  interpreted code only.

* The CLX documentation now also exists in HTML format.
  Thanks to Gilbert Baumann <unk6@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>.

* The normal read-eval-print loop does not call (CLEAR-INPUT *STANDARD-INPUT*)
  any more. This means that under X11, cut and paste of multiple lines into
  an xterm running clisp now works.
  Suggested by Sam Steingold.

* When opening socket servers, ignore EADDRINUSE errors coming from other
  sockets, in TIME_WAIT or CLOSE_WAIT state, hanging around on the port.
  Suggested by Don Cohen.

* Fixed a bug: When *PRINT-PRETTY* = T, (PRINC #\Newline) often caused two
  newline characters to be output instead of a single one.

* Fixed a bug: The sequence type functions refused to handle sequence types
  of the form ([SIMPLE-]ARRAY eltype 1). SUBTYPEP returned wrong results
  for type specifiers of the form ([SIMPLE-]ARRAY eltype n).

* Fixed a bug: GET-MACRO-CHARACTER on a dispatch macro character does not
  result in an error any more.

* Fixed a bug in ECASE, ETYPECASE, CCASE, CTYPECASE.
  These macros now accept T and OTHERWISE as keys.

* Fixed a bug: OPEN did not accept type specifiers defined by DEFTYPE as
  :ELEMENT-TYPE argument.

* Fixed a bug in the LOOP macro: Forms containing REPEAT clauses were
  executed too often in the presence of FOR-= clauses.

* Fixed a bug: The SPACE macro returned a list of the form's values, instead
  of the values themselves.

* Fixed a bug, implement X3J13 writeup <PRINC-READABLY:X3J13-DEC-91>:
  When *PRINT-READABLY* = T, (PRINC string) caused the string to be output
  in double-quotes instead of literally.

* X3J13 writeup <IGNORE-USE-TERMINOLOGY:VALUE-ONLY> is implemented:
  A "variable is used despite of IGNORE declaration" warning is not emitted
  any more for a variable that is only assigned to and not used for value.
  Suggested by Pierpaolo Bernardi.

* Fixed a bug in function FILE-AUTHOR on Win32.

* Fixed a bug: CLISP was unable to determine the user's homedir in
  certain (obscure) circumstances.

* Do not warn anymore if someone modifies one of the standard generic
  functions of CL like PRINT-OBJECT and INITIALIZE-INSTANCE.

Portability
-----------

* Added AmigaOS support for the socket functions. It's not perfect, but
  sufficient for writing socket clients.
  Thanks to Jörg Höhle.

* Port to Win32 using msvc5. (Previously only msvc4 was supported.)

* Dropped support for pre-ANSI-C compilers.

* Updated support for EMX.

* Dropped support for EMX versions older than 0.9c.

* Added support for PowerPC running MkLinux.

* Removed (incomplete) support for MS Windows 3.1.

Other modifications
-------------------

* `clisp-link' has a new command `run', to run a linking set with some
  modules loaded. If CLISP has been configured with option
  --with-dynamic-modules, this is much faster than constructing a
  temporary linking set.
  Suggested by Gilbert Baumann <unk6@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>.

* Compiling IFs with no else part now produce better code (Jörg Höhle).

* Speed up I/O to *STANDARD-INPUT*, *STANDARD-OUTPUT* and *TERMINAL-IO*:
  If standard input is redirected from a file, the input side of *TERMINAL-IO*
  will be buffered. If standard output is redirected to a file, the output
  side of *TERMINAL-IO* will be buffered.

* Dropped the STDWIN library.

* Added a new type encoding scheme which allows all address ranges from
  0x00000000 to 0x7FFFFFFF to be used. This should make porting to some
  systems easier.

* Added bindings to libc for Linux with libc6 (aka glibc 2.0).

* Miscellaneous documentation updates.

User visible changes
--------------------

* Fixed a bug which could cause a crash when Ctrl-C was pressed during heap
  allocation on i386.

Other modifications
-------------------

* The implementation notes now also exist in HTML format.


25 September 1997
=================

User visible changes
--------------------

* X3J13 vote <53> is implemented: DEFSTRUCT BOA constructors can have &KEY
  arguments.

* X3J13 vote <40> is partially implemented: New variable *READ-EVAL*.

* X3J13 vote <150> is implemented: (READTABLE-CASE readtable) can now have
  the value :INVERT.

* MAKE-PACKAGE and IN-PACKAGE accept a keyword argument :CASE-SENSITIVE.
  Similarly, DEFPACKAGE accepts an option :CASE-SENSITIVE. When its value is
  non-NIL, the package will be case sensitive, i.e. the reader will not
  case-convert symbol names before looking them up or creating them in this
  package. The package names are still subject to (READTABLE-CASE *READTABLE*),
  though.

* X3J13 vote <157> is implemented: ROOM accepts an optional argument with
  default value :DEFAULT.

* New macro SPACE. (SPACE form) evaluates form and prints information about
  the memory allocations caused by this evaluation.

* The spanish translation is now 100% complete. Thanks to Carlos Linares.

* DESCRIBE of a structure now displays the structure's slots.

* The reader now accepts the syntax #\^A ... #\^Z for the ASCII control
  characters.

* Fixed a CLOS bug: &ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS in lambda lists of INITIALIZE-INSTANCE
  now disables the validity checking of corresponding MAKE-INSTANCE calls.
  Thanks to Matthias Lindner <matthias@intellektik.informatik.th-darmstadt.de>.

* Fixed a bug: The type REAL is now accepted as a declaration specifier.

* Fixed a bug: When using GNU gettext, the LOCALIZED function always returned
  the value corresponding to language ENGLISH, and the interactive conflict
  resolution of some IMPORT/EXPORT package operations aborted with an internal
  error.

* Fixed a bug in the foreign function interface: call-ins did not work on
  some platforms.
  Thanks to Matthias Lindner <matthias@intellektik.informatik.th-darmstadt.de>.

* Fixed a bug: Calling the function SOCKET-SERVICE-PORT with a non-string
  argument caused a crash.

* Fixed two bugs which could cause a crash when a GC occurred during an
  IN-PACKAGE or during a pathname operation (DOS, OS/2, Win32 versions only).

* Added image support to the clx/new-clx module.
  Thanks to Gilbert Baumann <gilbert@ma2s2.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de>.

  more robust memory management.

* Added support for Win32 (WinNT and Win95), using Borland C++.

* Fixed a compilation error when compiling for sparcv8.
  Thanks to Hans Adams <adamsh@server.ecomp.de>.

* Reduced the number of conses allocated by calling APPLY on a function with
  both &KEY and &REST.
  Thanks to Jörg Höhle.

* The CLX documentation can now be viewed in ghostview.
  Thanks to Karl M. Hegbloom <karlheg@inetarena.com>.


7 August 1997
=============

User visible changes
--------------------

* Two new add-on modules:
    clx/new-clx: Fast Common Lisp to X11 interface. Written by
                 Gilbert Baumann <gilbert@ma2s2.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de>.
    clx/mit-clx: Classic Common Lisp to X11 interface.

* (DRIBBLE filename) now appends to the given file instead of overwriting it.

* Fixed a bug: Platform dependent constants are not inlined in .fas files any
  more.

* Fixed a bug: Binding *PRINT-PRETTY* to NIL inside a PRINT-OBJECT method or
  inside a structure's print-function could result in undefined behaviour.
  Thanks to Don Cohen <don@nichimen.com>.

* Fixed a bug: For x a float, (= 0 x) and (EQUALP 0 x) could result in
  undefined behaviour.
  Thanks to Don Cohen <don@nichimen.com>.

* Fixed a bug: The error message issued by CHECK-TYPE was wrong.

* Fixed a bug: Calling (DRIBBLE pathname) after (DRIBBLE) did not work.
  Thanks to Art Nuzzo <artn@bs724.comm.mot.com>.

* Fixed a bug: The WITH-STANDARD-IO-SYNTAX macro caused *PACKAGE* to be bound
  to an invalid value.

* Fixed two bugs in the GC (one in the generational GC, one in the
  non-generational GC).
  Big thanks to Marcus Daniels.

* Fixed a bug: Printing socket streams created by SOCKET-ACCEPT could result
  in an error or an endless loop.

Portability
-----------

* Added support for Win32 (WinNT and Win95), using Microsoft Visual C++.

* Added support for Cygwin32 version 18 (Unix emulation on WinNT or Win95).

* Added support for GNU 0.2 (the Hurd). Thanks to Marcus Daniels.

Other modifications
-------------------

* "clisp" can now be called with "-" as argument. The standard input is then
  executed by a read-eval-print loop without prompt, while the remaining
  arguments will be assigned to the variable *ARGS*.

* Overall speedup by 13% on i386.


3 May 1997
==========

User visible changes
--------------------

* X3J13 vote <182> is now fully implemented: A LET/LET*/COMPILER-LET binding
  specification may now be a list of length 1, without initial value.
  Thanks to Gilbert Baumann <gilbert@ma2s2.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de>.

* X3J13 vote <78> is now fully implemented: FLET, LABELS, MACROLET establish
  an implicit BLOCK.

* X3J13 vote <100> is implemented: Hash tables with test function EQUALP.

* X3J13 vote <131> is partially implemented: #P reader macro for pathnames.

* The MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND macro no longer allows lists as variable
  specifications, only symbols.
  Thanks to Gilbert Baumann <gilbert@ma2s2.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de>.

* DEFCLASS which changes a class is now allowed and generates a warning.
  Since UPDATE-INSTANCE-FOR-REDEFINED-CLASS is not supported, it is your
  responsibility to not use the old instances afterwards.
  Suggested by Brian Dennis <xjam@CS.Berkeley.EDU> and Tobias Kunze
  <tkunze@cmsgia.Stanford.EDU>.

* The TIME macro now outputs to *TRACE-OUTPUT* instead of *STANDARD-OUTPUT*.
  Thanks to Nathan Sidwell <nathan@bristol.st.com>.

* When the argument of the function TRANSLATE-LOGICAL-PATHNAME is a string,
  it is now interpreted as a logical pathname string. Previously, it was
  coerced to a pathname through the function PATHNAME, yielding a physical
  pathname.

* CLISP now supports more than the three predefined user-interface languages.
  New macros DEFLANGUAGE, DEFINTERNATIONAL, DEFLOCALIZED. New function
  LOCALIZED. The macros ENGLISH, DEUTSCH, FRANCAIS now work only for strings.
  Removed the macro LANGUAGE-CASE.
  The implementation uses the GNU gettext library.
  Thanks to Ulrich Drepper and Marcus Daniels.

* New user-interface language ESPANOL.
  Thanks to Carlos Linares López <clinares@delicias.dia.fi.upm.es> who has
  translated about 55% of CLISP's messages to Spanish.

* EQUALP now descends structures (but not CLOS instances!) on all platforms,
  as requested by X3J13 vote <71>.

* The EXIT-ON-ERROR macro now also exits when a Ctrl-C interrupt occurs.
  Thanks to Roger Kehr <kehr@iti.informatik.th-darmstadt.de>.

* The initial value of *LOAD-PATHS* on Unix is now (#"./" "~/lisp/**/")
  instead of (#"./" #"./**/" "~/**/"). To be customized in config.lsp.

* New variable *LOAD-COMPILING*, which provides the default value for the
  :COMPILING keyword of function LOAD. The initial value of *LOAD-COMPILING*
  can be specified by a command line option.

* Fixed a bug: (VALUES-LIST '()) often returned one value.
  Thanks to Gilbert Baumann <gilbert@ma2s2.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de>.

* Fixed a bug in the compiler: When optimizing (OR T form), the compiler
  could abort with an error message.
  Thanks to Nathan Sidwell <nathan@bristol.st.com>.

* Fixed a bug in the DEFSTRUCT macro which caused the compiler to issue
  an error message when compiling a structure definition containing a slot
  with a constant, non-NIL initializer.
  Thanks to Matthias Lindner <lindner@forwiss.uni-erlangen.de>.

* Fixed a bug in the DEFCLASS macro which caused DEFCLASS and DEFINE-CONDITION
  to reject the :DOCUMENTATION class option.
  Thanks to Don Cohen <donc@isi.edu>.

* Fixed a bug: The use of type specifiers of the form
  (FUNCTION argument-types result-type)
  within THE, ETHE, LOOP and DEFSTRUCT forms could lead to errors.
  Thanks to Marty Shannon <mshannon@i-2000.com>.

* Fixed two bugs in the DRIBBLE function: After calling (DRIBBLE pathname)
  followed by (DRIBBLE), *DEBUG-IO* referred to an unwritable stream.
  Calling (DRIBBLE pathname) from within a break loop caused some of the
  output to be logged twice.

* Fixed a bug in the expansion of deeply nested backquotes.
  Thanks to S. Wotherspoon <spoon@hilbert.maths.utas.edu.au>.

* Fixed a bug in the LOOP macro: Stepping for FOR-AS-= clauses
  (LOOP ... {FOR|AS} var = form1 THEN form2 ...) could be executed in the
  wrong order if form1 is constant and form2 is non-constant.
  Thanks to Russell Senior <seniorr@teleport.com>.

* Fixed a bug in /= : When called with more than two arguments, only the
  first two arguments were compared; the remaining arguments were ignored.
  Thanks to J. V. Needham <jv@rdk840.dfci.harvard.edu>.

* Fixed a bug in EQUAL and EQUALP: displaced strings were not compared
  correctly.

* Fixed a bug in EXPT: For x a (COMPLEX RATIONAL) and y = m/2^n, (EXPT X Y)
  actually returned x ^ (m/2^(n+32)) instead of x ^ (m/2^n).

* Fixed a bug in TRUENAME on Unix: If "aa.bb" is a symbolic link to "cc",
  (TRUENAME "aa.bb") returned "cc.bb" instead of "cc".

* Fixed a bug in the management of add-on modules: On some platforms,
  GC in memory images containing add-on modules always crashed.

* Fixed a bug in the generational GC on i386, rs6000, alpha: In some cases,
  FFI objects in memory could cause the first "small" garbage collection to
  fail.
  Thanks to Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>.

* Fixed a bug in the printing routine for SOCKET-SERVER objects.
  Thanks to Alexey Goldin <goldin@spot.uchicago.edu> and Marcus Daniels.

Portability
-----------

* The core of CLISP can now be compiled with a C++ compiler if no C compiler
  is available (without readline library, FFI or modules).

* Added support for Mips processors in 64-bit mode.

* Updated support for Linux 2.0.

* Support for immutable objects now works on Linux/ELF. It did already work
  on Linux/a.out.

* Updated Amiga support. Thanks to Jörg Höhle <Joerg.Hoehle@gmd.de>.

* Updated Acorn support. Thanks to Peter Burwood <clisp@arcangel.dircon.co.uk>.

* Updated OS/2 support. Thanks to Jörg Diederich <J_Diederich@herlab.ruhr.de>.

* Updated support for Solaris/x86. Thanks to Marty Shannon <mjs@tiaa-cref.org>.

* Fixed a bug which could cause the readline completion to dump core on HP-UX.

* Fixed a bug relating to the read-eval-print loop's return point on some
  platforms. Thanks to Peter Burwood <clisp@arcangel.dircon.co.uk>.

* Removed an incompatibility between SPARC/Sun4 and UltraSPARC memory images.
  Found by Martin Ginkel <ginkel@iik.cs.uni-magdeburg.de>.

* Removed support for AmigaOS versions < 2.04.

Other modifications
-------------------

* New "makemake" option --with-wide causes normal and wide-mode binaries to
  be built and distributed simultaneously. New command-line option -W
  for choosing the wide-mode binaries instead of the normal binaries.

* On Unix, "clisp" is now an executable instead of a shell script.

* "clisp" can now be called with a Lisp file as argument. The remaining
  arguments will be passed to the Lisp program in the variable *ARGS*.
  On Unix, you can thus make Lisp programs executable by putting
  "#!/usr/local/bin/clisp" in the first line and doing a "chmod a+x".

* The read-eval-print loop now calls FORCE-OUTPUT after outputting the prompt.
  Thanks to Jörg Höhle <Joerg.Hoehle@gmd.de>.

* Support for immutable objects now also works in the WIDE tagging scheme.

* Reduced the startup time by 20-30%.


21 July 1996
============

Important note
--------------

* Changed bytecode format. All .fas files generated by previous CLISP versions
  are invalid and must be recompiled.

User visible changes
--------------------

* X3J13 vote <72> is conditionally implemented: Objects other than symbols,
  lists, numbers, characters, string, bit-vectors are now self-evaluating if
  *PACKAGE* uses the COMMON-LISP package.

* The package CLOS is now among the default use list of a new package.
  (USE-PACKAGE "CLOS") is not needed any more. To use PCL, you now need
  to (UNUSE-PACKAGE "CLOS") explicitly.

* The bytecode format is now platform independent. As a consequence,
  compiled functions can be printed readably when *PRINT-READABLY* = T.

* Built-in function objects (SUBRs) are now printed readably when
  *PRINT-READABLY* = T, instead of signaling an error.

* Added a <c-type>, C-PTR-NULL to the FFI.  C-PTR-NULL will convert
  NIL objects into NULL pointers (so that type conflicts can be avoided).

* Socket streams are implemented. New functions SOCKET-SERVER,
  SOCKET-SERVER-CLOSE, SOCKET-SERVER-PORT, SOCKET-WAIT, SOCKET-ACCEPT,
  SOCKET-CONNECT, SOCKET-STREAM-HOST, SOCKET-STREAM-PORT, SOCKET-SERVICE-PORT,
  SOCKET-STREAM-PEER-HOST.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#socket> for details.
  Thanks to Marcus Daniels <marcus@sysc.pdx.edu> and
  Marco Ramoni <M.Ramoni@open.ac.uk>.

* Pipe streams now support binary I/O.

* MAKE-INSTANCE now also works for DEFSTRUCT classes, and DEFSTRUCT classes
  can now be subclassed via DEFCLASS with option :METACLASS STRUCTURE-CLASS.
  Suggested by Manuel Kolp <kolp@qant.ucl.ac.be>.

* User defined methods on NO-APPLICABLE-METHOD now have a chance for a
  corrective action. Thanks to Mark Thomas <thommark@access.digex.net>.

* APROPOS and DESCRIBE now tell you about symbols which name a type or class.

* During directory search, symbolic link loops are now ignored instead
  of resulting in an error. Thanks to Dan Stanger.

* Fixed a CLOS bug: REMOVE-METHOD did not work.
  Thanks to Roger Kehr <kehr@iti.informatik.th-darmstadt.de>.

* Fixed a bug in the compiler: A (MULTIPLE-VALUE-SETQ vars valform)
  or (MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND vars valform ...) form was miscompiled if
  valform is known to produce a single value.
  Thanks to Paul Graham <pg@das.harvard.edu>.

* Fixed at least two bugs in the LOOP macro: FOR-AS-ACROSS clauses could
  result in AREF signaling an out-of-bounds error at the end of the vector.
  Initialisations for FOR-AS-= clauses could be executed in the wrong order.

* Fixed a bug: the functions ENCODE-UNIVERSAL-TIME and DECODE-UNIVERSAL-TIME
  computed a wrong DST flag for time values between (T - 2h) and T, where
  T denotes a DST switch time.

* Fixed two bugs in the foreign function interface: multi-dimensional arrays
  and floating point numbers with value 0.0 were not correctly passed from
  "foreign land" to "Lisp land". Thanks to Ken Olum <kdo@mit.edu>.

* Fixed a bug in the foreign function interface: call-ins which return
  structures or unions would not compile correctly. Thanks to Michael Stoll.

* Fixed a bug: On Solaris, the function SYSTEM sometimes reported exit
  status 0 although the command had failed.
  Thanks to Brian F. Dennis <xjam@cs.Berkeley.edu>.

* Fixed a bug: LOGTEST did not work correctly if both arguments were bignums.

* Fixed a bug in the floating point number printing routine:
  In rare cases, a number was printed with more digits than necessary
  (without, however, violating the print-read consistency). For example,
  2.1416s29 printed as 2.14159s29, and 3.002618f-31 printed as 3.0026179f-31.

* Fixed a bug in ATAN: (ATAN y 0) with y < 0 returned pi/2 instead of -pi/2.

* Fixed a bug in XGCD which caused the results to be wrong with a small
  probability, for example in the case (XGCD 77874422 32223899).

Portability
-----------

* FreeBSD/NetBSD patches and compilation notes.
  Thanks to Douglas Crosher <dtc@stan.xx.swin.oz.au>.

* Added support for SUNWspro cc 3.0.1 on Sparc.

* Updated support for Ultrix.

* Updated support for NeXTstep version 3.3.
  Thanks to Robert Murphy <robert.murphy@yale.edu>.

* Updated support for SINIX. Thanks to Michael Becker <mb12@coconet.de>.

* Fixed a bug in the conversion of double-float numbers from "foreign land"
  to "Lisp land" on DEC Alpha. Thanks to Ken Olum <kdo@mit.edu>.

* Fixed a bug in the implementation of LISTEN on Irix: CLISP went into a
  `function call not implemented' OS error loop. Thanks to Marcus Daniels.

* Fixed a signal handling bug on some versions of SunOS 4: Strange things
  could happen in a break loop.

* The `configure' script now supports the --srcdir, --prefix and --exec-prefix
  options.

* Removed support for Atari ST/TT running TOS.

Other modifications
-------------------

* The compiler now recognizes more function calls as inlinable: Cases like
  (FUNCALL (LAMBDA ...) ...), (DECLAIM (INLINE F)) (MAPCAR #'F ...)
  are now compiled as inline function calls. Previously you had to write
  (FUNCTION (LAMBDA ...)) explicitly. Suggested by Jörg Höhle.

* "makemake" now supports the --srcdir, --prefix and --exec-prefix options.

* Added a testsuite for part of CLOS. Thanks to Christian Jullien.

* Miscellaneous documentation updates.

* The dpANS macro LAMBDA is implemented.

* The dpANS declaration IGNORABLE is implemented.

* The dpANS function CONSTANTLY is implemented. Thanks to Pierpaolo Bernardi.

* Better syntax checking for the CASE macro. Thanks to Pierpaolo Bernardi.

* The user interface language may be chosen through the environment variable
  LANG as well.

* The pretty printer now indents lists spanning more than one line by two
  spaces, instead of one. New variable *PRINT-INDENT-LISTS*.

* *PRINT-PRETTY* is now initially T.

* Foreign function interface: New foreign type constructor FFI:C-ARRAY-MAX,
  implements zero-terminated arrays of bounded size.

* On Unix, 8-bit characters are legal in pathnames if the operating system
  accepts them.

* On DOS, #\Newline is converted to CR/LF when doing character output to
  unbuffered file streams (referring to special files).

* Fixed a bug in the interpreter and compiler: A MULTIPLE-VALUE-SETQ form
  which assigns to a symbol macro expanded to a wrong form; compiling it
  produced a warning. Thanks to Pierpaolo Bernardi.

* Fixed a bug in the compiler: Some CASE form with duplicate keys, when
  compiled, chose the wrong clause to be executed.
  Thanks to Pierpaolo Bernardi.

* Fixed a bug in the #+/#- reader macros. (LIST #+FOO #-BAR 1 2 3) now
  returns (2 3), not (3).

* Fixed a bug in LOG: (LOG x^n x^m), where n, m are integers, |m| > 1, and
  x is a rational number /= 1, now correctly returns n/m. Previously,
  (LOG 2 4) returned 1/0.

* Fixed a CLOS bug: Using the :DOCUMENTATION option in DEFGENERIC declarations
  for function names of the form (SETF symbol) signalled an error.
  Thanks to Pierpaolo Bernardi.

* Fixed a bug in DEFSETF: An IGNORE declaration for the store variable had
  no effect. Thanks to Pierpaolo Bernardi.

Portability
-----------

* Added support for Linux/ELF. Thanks to Marcus Daniels.

* Added support for Solaris/x86. Thanks to Marty Shannon.

* On Solaris, LISTEN and READ-CHAR-NO-HANG did not work on the terminal stream
  if standard input was redirected to come from a file.

* On OS/2, consider the virtual directory \PIPE\ as existent.

Other modifications
-------------------

* A couple of bug fixes and new functions in the STDWIN package.
  Thanks to Pierpaolo Bernardi.

* The structure of external modules has changed a bit.

* Miscellaneous documentation updates.


25 April 1995
=============

User visible changes
--------------------

* Michael Stoll has written a graphical user interface for CLISP under
  NeXTstep.

* Added a foreign language module WILDCARD for wildcard matching.

* Added a foreign language module REGEXP for Unix-style regular expression
  matching and searching.

* X3J13 vote <94> is implemented: Calling GENSYM has no side effects except
  incrementing the counter. New variable *GENSYM-COUNTER*.

* New macro FORMATTER converts a FORMAT control string to a function.

* Some FORMAT fixes:
  + X3J13 vote <81> is implemented: The FORMAT ~:^ directive is more useful.
    Warning: Old style "~:^" directives need to be converted to "~#:^".
  + X3J13 vote <82> is implemented: The FORMAT ~D, ~B, ~O, ~X, ~R directives
    accept an optional comma-interval parameter.
  + X3J13 vote <84> is implemented: FORMAT ~C outputs characters with no bits
    as if by WRITE-CHAR.
  + Handling of ~^ within the FORMAT ~? directive.

* X3J13 vote <167> is implemented: New types FILE-STREAM, SYNONYM-STREAM,
  BROADCAST-STREAM, CONCATENATED-STREAM, TWO-WAY-STREAM, ECHO-STREAM,
  STRING-STREAM. New functions OPEN-STREAM-P, SYNONYM-STREAM-SYMBOL,
  BROADCAST-STREAM-STREAMS, CONCATENATED-STREAM-STREAMS,
  TWO-WAY-STREAM-INPUT-STREAM, TWO-WAY-STREAM-OUTPUT-STREAM,
  ECHO-STREAM-INPUT-STREAM, ECHO-STREAM-OUTPUT-STREAM.

* New condition type PRINT-NOT-READABLE.
  New function PRINT-NOT-READABLE-OBJECT.

* New function FINALIZE. (FINALIZE object function) has the effect that
  function will be called when object is being garbage collected.

* DRIBBLE now also redirects *ERROR-OUTPUT*, *TRACE-OUTPUT*, *QUERY-IO*,
  *DEBUG-IO* if they refer to *TERMINAL-IO*.

* Calling SYMBOL-VALUE on a symbol defined as global symbol macro now returns
  the value of the expansion. New function SYMBOL-MACRO-EXPAND.

* Add FFI to the *FEATURES* if the foreign language interface is present.

* Fixed a bug: An IGNORE declaration for a macro's &ENVIRONMENT argument now
  has an effect.

* Fixed a couple of bugs in the foreign language interface: Passing zero size
  arrays did not work, parameters with mode :OUT did not work on SPARC and
  HP-PA, and some error messages were deficient.

* Fixed a bogus error message in SET-DISPATCH-MACRO-CHARACTER.

Portability
-----------

* Fixed a couple of building problems relating to the foreign language
  interface (missing `mark_fp_invalid' and `pr_hex8', missing makefile
  dependencies, support for --with-dynamic-modules, warnings when compiling
  user2.lsp and foreign1.lsp).

* Fixed a building problem: Not all C compilers accept casts in constant
  expressions used as initializers, e.g. gcc-2.5.8.

* Foreign function interface: Fixed a couple of possible bugs in the low-level
  foreign function call routine for i386/486/586, m680x0, SPARC CPUs.
  Thanks to Jörg Höhle.

* Small fixes for SCO.

* Added a utility "hln" for making hard links. Needed for "make distrib";
  Solaris "ln" does not make a hard link if a symbolic link is involved.

* On some Unix systems, use "uname -m", not "arch", to determine
  (MACHINE-TYPE) and (MACHINE-VERSION).

* More support for BSDI 1.0, AIX, HP-UX, Solaris.

* Changed STDWIN so that it compiles under X11R6.

Other modifications
-------------------

* Speed up compiled calls to FORMAT with literal control string by use of
  FORMATTER.

* Miscellaneous documentation updates.


4 April 1995
============

User visible changes
--------------------

* The initial value of *PACKAGE* can be specified by a command line option.

* X3J13 vote <6> is implemented: New place ROW-MAJOR-AREF.

* X3J13 vote <126> is implemented: New function DELETE-PACKAGE.

* X3J13 vote <14> is implemented: Closing a synonym stream does not close
  its constituent stream.

* Foreign language interface for C and ANSI C. New package FFI. New macros
  FFI:DEF-C-TYPE, FFI:DEF-C-VAR, FFI:DEF-C-CALL-OUT, FFI:DEF-C-CALL-IN,
  FFI:DEF-C-ENUM, FFI:DEF-C-STRUCT, FFI:DEF-CALL-OUT, FFI:DEF-CALL-IN,
  FFI:ELEMENT, FFI:DEREF, FFI:SLOT, FFI:CAST, FFI:TYPEOF, FFI:SIZEOF,
  FFI:BITSIZEOF.
  This currently works only on Unix and only with the CPUs
  i386/486/586, m680x0, Mips, SPARC, DEC Alpha, HP-PA, RS/6000.
  Warning: (COMPILE-FILE "filename.lsp") now overwrites the file "filename.c".

* New macros MUFFLE-CERRORS and APPEASE-CERRORS. During their execution,
  continuable errors are handled by the function CONTINUE. MUFFLE-CERRORS
  does this silently, APPEASE-CERRORS prints the error as a warning.

* New macro EXIT-ON-ERROR. During its execution, non-continuable errors
  cause CLISP to exit with error status.

* The function ED, when asked to edit a non-existent file, now creates that
  file instead of signaling an error.

* When a non-absolute pathname is specified for the -o command line option
  (destination file of a compilation), it is interpreted as relative to the
  current directory, not relative to the source file of the compilation.

* The readline library now uses the last column of the screen if the terminal
  is an xterm, for example. Work done by Chet Ramey.

* Fixed two bugs in the LOOP macro: FOR-AS-ACROSS clauses could result in AREF
  signaling an out-of-bounds error at the end of the vector. Initialisations
  for FOR-AS-= clauses could be executed in the wrong order.

* Fixed a bug in the compiler which caused LOAD-TIME-VALUE forms to be
  evaluated at compile time.

* Fixed a bug in the debugger: Choosing a restart Rnnn always invoked the
  last restart listed, not the chosen one.

* Fixed a bug: (CLOSE *TERMINAL-IO*) signals an error again.

* On DOS and OS/2, the Lisp reader now treats Ctrl-Z as whitespace.

* The -I command line option now tells the readline library to handle the Tab
  character as normal self-inserting character.

* Unix version only: DISASSEMBLE can display machine instructions, provided
  that GNU gdb is present.

Portability
-----------

* Updated support for EMX.

* Fixed a bug which caused a preprocessor error on SunOS and OSF/1.

* Small fixes for Sinix and SCO.

* Removed support for Coherent.

Other modifications

* Generational garbage collection now also works on IRIX 5.2.

* Generational garbage collection and support for immutable objects do not
  exclude each other any more.

* Speed up the bytecode interpreter by about 2%.

* Miscellaneous documentation updates.

* Renamed `target' to `configure'.

* Added a manual page in HTML format.

* Miscellaneous documentation updates.


26 October 1994
===============

Important note
--------------

* Changed bytecode format. All .fas files generated by previous CLISP versions
  are invalid and must be recompiled.

User visible changes
--------------------

* X3J13 vote <77> is implemented: CL:FLET, CL:LABELS, CL:MACROLET allow
  declarations.

* X3J13 vote <78> is implemented: CL:FLET, CL:LABELS, CL:MACROLET, DEFTYPE,
  DEFSETF, DEFINE-SETF-METHOD establish an implicit BLOCK.

* X3J13 vote <128> is implemented: MAKE-PATHNAME, PATHNAME-HOST,
  PATHNAME-DEVICE, PATHNAME-DIRECTORY, PATHNAME-NAME, PATHNAME-TYPE have
  a keyword argument :CASE. Thanks to Marcus Daniels.

* X3J13 vote <137> is implemented: New functions WILD-PATHNAME-P,
  PATHNAME-MATCH-P and TRANSLATE-PATHNAME. Thanks to Marcus Daniels.

* X3J13 vote <130> is implemented: New built-in type LOGICAL-PATHNAME.
  New place LOGICAL-PATHNAME-TRANSLATIONS. New functions LOGICAL-PATHNAME,
  TRANSLATE-LOGICAL-PATHNAME, LOAD-LOGICAL-PATHNAME-TRANSLATIONS,

* X3J13 vote <132> is implemented: Synonym streams to file streams are
  allowed as pathnames.

* Amiga version: SCREEN package is implemented. Thanks to Jörg Höhle.

* The debugger emits some more messages to *DEBUG-IO*, not *ERROR-OUTPUT*.

* (COERCE symbol 'FUNCTION) now works.

* Fixed a bug in ENOUGH-NAMESTRING: In many cases, a relative directory
  specification was returned instead of an absolute directory specification.

* Fixed a CLOS bug which caused (DEFCLASS FOO (STANDARD-OBJECT) ()) and
  (DEFINE-CONDITION FOO (CONDITION) ()) to signal errors.

* Fixed a bug: In some situations, USE-PACKAGE reported a name conflict when
  there was none.

* Fixed a bug: (READ-CHAR-NO-HANG stream nil eof-object) now signals an error
  if stream is not an input stream. Previously it returned eof-object.

* Fixed a bug: On some Unix systems, (FINISH-OUTPUT *TERMINAL-IO*) signalled
  an error if standard output was redirected to a file.

* (SQRT 0) now returns an integer 0 instead of a floating-point 0.0.

* Readline library: Fixed a small problem with input prompts longer than the
  screen width.

* Fixed three bugs in the built-in editor. One of them made the editor
  entirely unusable.

Portability
-----------

* Added some support for MS Windows.

* On DOS, the readline library now handles the /!INPUTRC and history files
  correctly.

* Some modification for the sake of gcc-2.6.1.

Other modifications
-------------------

* Generational garbage collection now also works on Linux (1.1.52 or newer).

* On Unix, external modules written in C can be linked to CLISP without
  recompiling CLISP from source. For example, the STDWIN library.

* Small fix: On some machines, some internal objects were being printed as
  #<SYSTEM-POINTER ...> instead of #<FRAME-POINTER ...>.

* Miscellaneous documentation updates.


1 September 1994
================

User visible changes
--------------------

* The DEFCONSTANT warning about redefinition of a constant is also inhibited
  if the constant's new and old values are the same string (in the sense of
  EQUAL). Thanks to Marcus Daniels.

* Unix version only: The daylight saving time flag of a time zone (eighth
  value of GET-DECODED-TIME and DECODE-UNIVERSAL-TIME) is now correct.

-----------

* Added support for Acorn ARM running RISCOS. Thanks to Peter Burwood.

* Added support for NetBSD 1.0. Thanks to Douglas Crosher.

* Updated support for EMX and DJGPP.

* GNU malloc for HP-UX now works.


23 August 1994
==============

User visible changes
--------------------

* X3J13 vote <64> is implemented: New macro DESTRUCTURING-BIND.

* The function ED can now edit functions that have been entered in
  interpreted form even if they have later been compiled.

* New function UNCOMPILE. (UNCOMPILE function-name) undoes the effect of
  (COMPILE function-name) if the function's definition had been entered
  in interpreted form.

* The OPEN option :IF-EXISTS :RENAME-AND-DELETE now deletes the renamed
  file. Previously :RENAME-AND-DELETE was equivalent to :RENAME.

* (LISP-IMPLEMENTATION-VERSION) returns a more precise version string.

* Readline library: Completion of a function call with no arguments
  automatically adds the closing parenthesis.

* Readline library: When a closing parenthesis is typed, the corresponding
  opening parenthesis is displayed.

Portability
-----------

  ISO Latin-1, IBM PC, HP Roman8, NeXTstep and Atari ST character sets.

* The `configure' script now prints its results.

* Floating point computations on some CPUs (Sparc, HP-PA, M88000, RS/6000):
  Fixed some confusion between overflow and NaN and between underflow and zero.

* Removed support for Atari Turbo-C (now known as PURE-C).

Other modifications
-------------------

* Copyright clarification.

* Generational garbage collection. This works only for Unix implementations
  with powerful virtual memory management, currently only SunOS.

* Improved virtual memory efficiency:
  - Memory model SPVW_PAGES: do not put a piece of management data into
    every page.
  - Memory model SPVW_BLOCKS: compact conses, do not shuffle them, so that
    they are kept sorted according to their age.
  - Memory model SPVW_PURE_BLOCKS: pages containing garbage are
    immediately freed.

* Unix version only: To reduce the startup time, try to use mmap() instead
  of read() for the startup file.

* Added a readline manual page.

* Miscellaneous documentation updates.


4 July 1994
===========

User visible changes
--------------------

* X3J13 votes <115> and <114> are implemented: an elaborate LOOP macro.
  New macro LOOP-FINISH.
  Warning: The scoping rules for the iteration variables are hairy. If a
  FOR/AS initialisation form refers to an iteration variable of a subsequent
  FOR/AS clause, the effects are implementation dependent!

* X3J13 vote <120> is implemented: New function MAP-INTO.

* X3J13 vote <79> is implemented: New constants
  LEAST-POSITIVE-NORMALIZED-SHORT-FLOAT,
  LEAST-NEGATIVE-NORMALIZED-SHORT-FLOAT,
  LEAST-POSITIVE-NORMALIZED-SINGLE-FLOAT,
  LEAST-NEGATIVE-NORMALIZED-SINGLE-FLOAT,
  LEAST-POSITIVE-NORMALIZED-DOUBLE-FLOAT,
  LEAST-NEGATIVE-NORMALIZED-DOUBLE-FLOAT,
  LEAST-POSITIVE-NORMALIZED-LONG-FLOAT,
  LEAST-NEGATIVE-NORMALIZED-LONG-FLOAT.

* The macro WITH-OUTPUT-TO-PRINTER now also works on DOS.

* Fixed a bug in DO-SYMBOLS: A symbol which is exported from a used package
  was considered accessible in the using package even if it was shadowed by
  another present symbol of the same name.

* Fixed a bug in the debugger which caused the BACKTRACE commands to print
  garbage if the current user interface language was not English.

Other modifications
-------------------

* Miscellaneous documentation updates.


22 June 1994
============

User visible changes
--------------------

* French support is now complete. Thanks to Jörg Höhle.

* The user interface language (english, german or french) can now be chosen
  at startup time through a command line option. The constant *LANGUAGE* has
  been removed, and its value has been removed from *FEATURES*. New macros
  ENGLISH, DEUTSCH, FRANCAIS and LANGUAGE-CASE.

* There is a command line option that makes CLISP behave more like what
  ILISP (a popular Emacs LISP interface) expects.

* The function CLOS:CALL-NEXT-METHOD can now be called with arguments, but
  the check that the set of applicable methods must be the same as for the
  original arguments will be bypassed.

* New functions READ-CHAR-SEQUENCE, WRITE-CHAR-SEQUENCE, READ-BYTE-SEQUENCE,
  WRITE-BYTE-SEQUENCE which perform fast block I/O.

* Errors of type FLOATING-POINT-UNDERFLOW are inhibited in floating point
  computations (and zero is returned instead) during execution of the new
  macro WITHOUT-FLOATING-POINT-UNDERFLOW.

* X3J13 vote <95> is implemented: If the readtable argument passed to
  GET-MACRO-CHARACTER and GET-DISPATCH-MACRO-CHARACTER is NIL, the standard
  readtable is used.

* PROBE-FILE does not report an error any more if an intermediate directory
  in the path does not exist. NIL is returned instead.

* The DEFCONSTANT warning about redefinition of a constant is inhibited if
  the constant's new and old values are the same (in the sense of EQL).
  Thanks to Marcus Daniels.

* The function INTERACTIVE-STREAM-P knows that if the terminal stream is
  referring to a regular file (via input redirection) it is not interactive.

* There is a user programmable kind of streams, called generic streams.
  New functions MAKE-GENERIC-STREAM, GENERIC-STREAM-CONTROLLER,
  GENERIC-STREAM-P, GENERIC-STREAM-READ-CHAR, GENERIC-STREAM-READ-BYTE,
  GENERIC-STREAM-LISTEN, GENERIC-STREAM-WRITE-CHAR, GENERIC-STREAM-WRITE-BYTE,
  GENERIC-STREAM-WRITE-STRING, GENERIC-STREAM-CLEAR-INPUT,
  GENERIC-STREAM-CLEAR-OUTPUT, GENERIC-STREAM-FINISH-OUTPUT,
  GENERIC-STREAM-FORCE-OUTPUT, GENERIC-STREAM-CLOSE.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#gstream> for details.
  Thanks to Marcus Daniels and Don Cohen.

* The macro WITH-OUTPUT-TO-PRINTER may now also work on OS/2.

* Fixed a CLOS bug: Generic functions with both optional and keyword
  arguments did not work.

* Fixed a serious bug in the compiler which caused incorrect code to be
  generated for functions like (LAMBDA (X) (SETQ X 1)).

* Fixed a serious bug in the compiler which caused the compiler to crash
  when compiling functions which contain two or more calls to ASSERT.

* Fixed a bug: The macroexpander of MULTIPLE-VALUE-SETQ built up a
  syntactically illegal form.

* Fixed a bug in the reader: When reading pathnames from the syntax
  #S(PATHNAME ...), #n# references in pathname components were not
  resolved prior to calling MAKE-PATHNAME.

* Fixed a bug in the reader: (read-from-string "1/") signalled an error
  of type DIVISION-BY-ZERO.

* Fixed a bug in the terminal stream: If several consecutive READ-LINE
  operations on the terminal stream were performed without any text
  containing newlines being output between them, the prompt finally got
  duplicated and then became longer and longer.

* Fixed a bug in the readline library (bad handling of prompts longer than
  one line). Thanks to Marcus Daniels.

Installation
------------

* All non-Unix versions: Setting the local time zone should now be much
  easier. 122 time zone names are supported.

Portability
-----------

* Unix version only: Getting the time zone should be more robust.

* Added support for NeXT (68k or i386 CPU) running NeXTstep 3.2.
  Thanks to Marcus Daniels.

* Changed bytecode format. All .fas files generated by previous CLISP versions
  are invalid and must be recompiled.

User visible changes
--------------------

* X3J13 votes <186> and <31> are implemented: the Common Lisp Condition System.
  New macros
    DEFINE-CONDITION, IGNORE-ERRORS, HANDLER-CASE, HANDLER-BIND,
    RESTART-CASE, WITH-RESTARTS, WITH-SIMPLE-RESTART, RESTART-BIND,
    WITH-CONDITION-RESTARTS,
  new types
    RESTART, CONDITION, SERIOUS-CONDITION, ERROR, PROGRAM-ERROR, CONTROL-ERROR,
    ARITHMETIC-ERROR, DIVISION-BY-ZERO, FLOATING-POINT-OVERFLOW,
    FLOATING-POINT-UNDERFLOW, CELL-ERROR, UNBOUND-VARIABLE, UNDEFINED-FUNCTION,

    STREAM-ERROR-STREAM, FILE-ERROR-PATHNAME, SIMPLE-CONDITION-FORMAT-STRING,
    SIMPLE-CONDITION-FORMAT-ARGUMENTS,
  new variables
    *BREAK-ON-SIGNALS*, *DEBUGGER-HOOK*.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#conditions> for details.
  Thanks to David Gadbois who wrote most of this.

* X3J13 vote <40> is partially implemented: New variable *PRINT-READABLY*.

* X3J13 vote <34> is implemented: Arrays and packages may now appear as
  constants in compiled code.

* X3J13 vote <90> is implemented: FUNCTIONP on symbols and conses now always
  returns NIL. The type FUNCTION is disjoint from SYMBOL and CONS.
  (COERCE object 'FUNCTION) is implemented.
  Warning: Old style calls like
    (FUNCTIONP object)
  may need to be converted to
    (OR (FUNCTIONP object)
        (SYMBOLP object)
        (AND (CONSP object) (EQ (CAR object) 'LAMBDA))
    )
  This fixes a CLOS bug: (TYPEP object 'FUNCTION) was not equivalent to
  (TYPEP object (FIND-CLASS 'FUNCTION)).

* Two new debugger commands Break+ and Break- permit to set resp. remove
  breakpoints at specified EVAL or APPLY frames.

* Warnings and errors produced by COMPILE-FILE are now accompanied by
  source line number information.

* The sub-char passed as second argument to read dispatch macros is now
  exactly the first non-digit read from the stream. Previously it was its
  upper-case equivalent.

* DEFPACKAGE now accepts an option (:DOCUMENTATION docstring).

* DIRECTORY now accepts a keyword argument :CIRCLE. If it is non-NIL,
  the directory search for ".../" and "**/" wildcards on Unix avoids endless
  loops that may result from symbolic links.

* The variable *LOAD-PATHS* in the Unix versions of config.lsp now uses
  "~/" (the home directory at run time) instead of #"~/" (the home directory
  at installation time). Thanks to Gabor Herr.

* Unix and OS/2 versions: New dangerous functions MAKE-PIPE-IO-STREAM,
  RUN-SHELL-COMMAND and RUN-PROGRAM.

* Unix version only:
  The command shell used by MAKE-PIPE-...-STREAM is now always /bin/sh; the
  environment variable SHELL is only used as interactive shell.
  Fixed a race condition in the functions EXECUTE, MAKE-PIPE-INPUT-STREAM,
  MAKE-PIPE-OUTPUT-STREAM that caused the child process to fail mysteriously.

* Attacks such as  (DO-ALL-SYMBOLS (S) (UNLESS (CONSTANTP S) (SET S NIL)))
  no longer crash CLISP.

* Fixed a CLOS bug: DEFCLASS failed to signal an error if several direct slots
  had identical names.

* Fixed a bug in the reader: When reading hash tables which contain #n#
  references, the hash codes must be recomputed after resolving the
  references. Thanks to Marcus Daniels.

* Fixed a bug in the printer: Printed representations with two different
  #1= definitions could result when PRINT-OBJECT methods were called while
  *PRINT-CIRCLE* was true. Thanks to Marcus Daniels.

Portability
-----------

* Fixed five bugs in the number crunching routines that appeared on
  64-bit processors or in combination with the WIDE tagging scheme.

* More support for 64-bit processors like DEC Alpha.

* Added support for NeXT running NeXTstep 3.1. Thanks to Marcus Daniels.

* Added support for Amiga 3000 running AMIX Unix. Thanks to Michel Loi.

* Fixed a problem with Ctrl-C on HP-UX. Thanks to Gabor Herr.

* Added support for HP9000/300 running HP-UX. Thanks to Gabor Herr.

* Added support for WATCOM C 9.5 on DOS.

  argument --with-stdwin.

* X3J13 vote <108> is implemented: New packages COMMON-LISP and
  COMMON-LISP-USER.

* X3J13 vote <112> is implemented:
  LOAD binds the variables *LOAD-PATHNAME* and *LOAD-TRUENAME*, COMPILE-FILE
  binds the variables *COMPILE-FILE-PATHNAME* and *COMPILE-FILE-TRUENAME*.
  New variables *LOAD-PATHNAME*, *LOAD-TRUENAME*, *COMPILE-FILE-PATHNAME*,
  *COMPILE-FILE-TRUENAME*.

* X3J13 vote <26> is implemented: COMPILE-FILE has a keyword argument :PRINT.
  New variables *COMPILE-WARNINGS*, *COMPILE-VERBOSE*, *COMPILE-PRINT*.

* Fixed two bugs in DEFPACKAGE: *PACKAGE* is not modified by DEFPACKAGE
  any more, and the :INTERN option now works.

* Fixed FUNCTION-LAMBDA-EXPRESSION such that it works on built-in functions.
  Thanks to France Dacar.

* Fixed a serious bug in GCD on 16-bit processors: (GCD x y) with
  2^k - 2^(k-16) <= |x|,|y| < 2^k could cause a division by zero.

Portability
-----------

* Added support for DEC Alpha AXP running OSF/1 Unix.

* Added support for Apple Mac II running A/UX.

* Added support for Atari ST/TT running MiNT. Thanks to Scott Kolodzieski.

* Support for SunOS4 cc now works.

* The makefile now also works with "parallel" make utilities (e.g. GNU make
  with option -j). Thanks to Rick Sladkey.

* Easier porting: The most dangerous optimizations (inline asm() statements,
  global register allocations, ...) are inhibited if CLISP is compiled with
  option SAFETY=3.

* Some modifications for the sake of gcc-2.5.

Other modifications
-------------------

* Speed up generic function dispatch.

* Some kinds of objects take less space (all CPUs except 680x0).

* The list of X3J13 votes and their current status in CLISP has been moved
  from file `src/defs2.lsp' to file `src/cltl2.txt'.

* The code for setting up a connection to an X server (file `src/socket.d')
  has been completely rewritten.

* Miscellaneous documentation updates.


27 September 1993
=================

User visible changes
--------------------

* COMPILE-FILE now handles top-level forms as described in CLtL2 p. 90:
  The macroexpansion of a top-level form is considered a top-level form.
  When a top-level form is a PROGN, LOCALLY, COMPILER-LET, SYMBOL-MACROLET
  or MACROLET form, the subforms of its body are considered top-level forms
  too and are compiled separately.
  This allows things like
    (PROGN (DEFCONSTANT X 3141) (DEFUN GET-X () X))
  or
    (PROGN (DEFCLASS SHIP () ()) (DEFUN SHIP-P (X) (TYPEP X 'SHIP)))
  to work.
  Warning: If you want to inhibit this splitting into separate forms (for
  example, because several of the forms refer to the same uninterned symbol),
  you have to use (LET () (PROGN ...)) instead of (PROGN ...).

* X3J13 vote <144> is implemented: New macro DECLAIM.

* X3J13 vote <113> is implemented: The macro LOCALLY is now a special form.

* Fixed a serious bug in the compiler: When compiling functions inline
  whose parameters are special variables, incorrect code could be generated.

* Fixed a bug in the compiler which caused the compiler to crash in some
  rare cases, notably when compiling Garnet-2.2.

* Fixed a bug that prevented the debugger commands DOWN and BOTTOM from
  working on Linux and SunOS.

* Fixed a CLOS bug: Specifying &KEY without &REST in generic function
  lambda lists did not have the desired effect.

* DEFCLASS supports both :DEFAULT-INITARGS syntaxes.

* DEFGENERIC is more tolerant about invalid declarations.

Portability
-----------

* Added Dynix/ptx Sequent support. Thanks to Esther Davis.

* Added support for RS/6000 CPU and AIX. Thanks to Gabor Herr.

Other modifications
-------------------

* Made the memory allocation and (ROOM), (TIME ...) more virtual memory
  efficient (less paging on Unix and DOS). Thanks to Don Cohen.

* Added Geoffrey Gordon's "LISP tutorial".

* Renamed stdwin.lsp to stdwin2.lsp.

* Miscellaneous documentation updates.


1 September 1993
================

Important note
--------------

* Changed bytecode format. All .fas files generated by previous CLISP versions
  are invalid and must be recompiled.

User visible changes
--------------------

* Unix version only: The command line option -M now also accepts memory images
  that were compressed using GNU gzip.

* Fixed a CLOS bug: MAKE-INSTANCE now behaves as if it were calling
  INITIALIZE-INSTANCE, and INITIALIZE-INSTANCE and REINITIALIZE-INSTANCE
  behave as if they were calling SHARED-INITIALIZE.

* Fixed a CLOS bug: NO-APPLICABLE-METHOD failed to be called in some cases
  when no method was applicable.

* Relating to X3J13 vote <89>: The first argument to the functions FUNCALL and
  APPLY, denoting a function, may now also be a list (SETF symbol).

* Fixed a bogus error message that occurred when storing an out-of-range
  integer into an array of element-type (UNSIGNED-BYTE 32).

Portability
-----------

* Added NetBSD support. Thanks to Charles Hannum.

Other modifications
-------------------

* Added Jeff Dalton's "brief CLOS guide".

* Miscellaneous documentation updates.


22 August 1993
==============

Important note
--------------

* Changed bytecode format. All .fas files generated by previous CLISP versions
  are invalid and must be recompiled.

User visible changes
--------------------

* X3J13 vote <12> is partially implemented: Native CLOS. New package CLOS
  containing the macros
    DEFCLASS, DEFMETHOD, DEFGENERIC, GENERIC-FUNCTION, GENERIC-FLET,
    GENERIC-LABELS, WITH-SLOTS, WITH-ACCESSORS,
  the functions
    FIND-CLASS, (SETF FIND-CLASS), CLASS-OF, CLASS-NAME, (SETF CLASS-NAME),
    SLOT-VALUE, SLOT-BOUNDP, SLOT-MAKUNBOUND, SLOT-EXISTS-P,
    CALL-NEXT-METHOD, NEXT-METHOD-P,
    NO-APPLICABLE-METHOD, NO-PRIMARY-METHOD, NO-NEXT-METHOD,
    FIND-METHOD, ADD-METHOD, REMOVE-METHOD, COMPUTE-APPLICABLE-METHODS,
    METHOD-QUALIFIERS, FUNCTION-KEYWORDS, SLOT-MISSING, SLOT-UNBOUND,
    PRINT-OBJECT, DESCRIBE-OBJECT, MAKE-INSTANCE, INITIALIZE-INSTANCE,
    REINITIALIZE-INSTANCE, SHARED-INITIALIZE,
  the classes
    STANDARD-CLASS, STRUCTURE-CLASS, BUILT-IN-CLASS, STANDARD-OBJECT,
    STANDARD-GENERIC-FUNCTION, STANDARD-METHOD and all predefined classes,
  and the method combination
    STANDARD.
  See <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#classes> for details.
  X3J13 vote <13> is implemented, too.

* X3J13 vote <63> is implemented: DESCRIBE receives the output stream as
  optional argument. New function CLOS:DESCRIBE-OBJECT.

* X3J13 vote <149> is implemented: The second argument to SUBSEQ may now
  be NIL. Thanks to Thomas Kirk.

* X3J13 vote <175> is implemented: TAILP now also works on dotted lists.

* X3J13 vote <124> is implemented: (DECLARE (OPTIMIZE (DEBUG ...))) is legal.

* The type specifier (EQL object), a synonym for (MEMBER object), is now
  implemented.

* New DEFSTRUCT option :INHERIT which is exactly like :INCLUDE except that it
  does not create new accessors for the inherited slots. Use this option to
  avoid the problems that occur when using the same :CONC-NAME for the new
  and the inherited structure.

* Fixed EXPORT and USE-PACKAGE: Do not signal a name conflict between the
  symbol being exported and a symbol accessible in the using package if
  the latter symbol is on the list of shadowing symbols of the using package.

* Fixed VECTOR-PUSH-EXTEND. It now works on vectors of dimension 0 and
  on bit-vectors.

* Fixed PRINT-UNREADABLE-OBJECT: Do not output adjacent spaces.

* Fixed a bug in the reader that caused an endless loop or endless recursion
  when resolving #n=/#n# references in objects that already contained cyclic
  data structures, e.g. when reading (#1=a #.'#2=(b . #2#) #1#).

* Fixed a bogus error message in the complex number reader.

Portability
-----------

* The DOS README explains how to run CLISP in the DOS box of Microsoft
  Windows. Thanks to Ralf Muschall.

* Added Sinix support. Thanks to Manfred Weichel.

* Improved installation on OS/2.

Other modifications
-------------------

* A function proclaimed INLINE will be taken inline in a wider set of
  circumstances. (Previously INLINE worked only when that function was being
  used in the same file or in a file that REQUIREd the file defining the
  function.)

* The compiler now produces better code for (APPLY (FUNCTION fun) args).

* Changed the default memory size from 2 megabytes to 2.5 megabytes.

* Miscellaneous documentation updates.


17 July 1993
============

User visible changes
--------------------

* X3J13 vote <150> is mostly implemented: Reading and printing of symbols
  (and characters with bits or fonts attributes) is now affected by
  (READTABLE-CASE *READTABLE*), whose value may be one of :UPCASE, :DOWNCASE
  and :PRESERVE. New place READTABLE-CASE.

* Support for immutable objects is implemented. Attempts to modify read-only
  data will signal an error. Program text and quoted constants loaded from
  files are considered read-only data. Never again will you be allowed to
  write programs that destructively modify themselves!
  This works only for Unix implementations with powerful virtual memory
  management, currently only Linux and SunOS. To enable it, you have to
  add -DIMMUTABLE to the CFLAGS in the makefile when building CLISP.

* Fixed DEFUN such that
  (progn
    (flet ((bar (x) (+ x 10))) (defun bar (y) (if (zerop y) 1 (bar (1- y))))
    (bar 1)
  )
  returns 10 instead of 1.

* Fixed a bug in the compiler that caused the compiler to crash by endless
  recursion and stack overflow when compiling assignments to symbol macros.

Portability
-----------

* Added support for m88000 CPU.

* Amiga version: detect 68000 CPU, for better use of present memory.

Other modifications
-------------------

* Miscellaneous documentation updates.


29 June 1993
============

User visible changes
--------------------

* X3J13 vote <89> is implemented: (SETF symbol) is now a valid syntax for a
  function name in (funname ...), (FUNCTION funname), (DEFUN funname ...),
  (COMPILE funname ...), (DISASSEMBLE funname), (ED funname), FLET, LABELS etc.
  New function FDEFINITION.

* X3J13 vote <173> is implemented: New special form SYMBOL-MACROLET. The
  macroexpansion environment passed to macro expanders and to MACROEXPAND-1,
  MACROEXPAND, GET-SETF-METHOD, GET-SETF-METHOD-MULTIPLE-VALUE now comprises
  both the variable environment and the function environment.
  New macro DEFINE-SYMBOL-MACRO.

* New macro PRINT-UNREADABLE-OBJECT.

* Fixed a bug: The string comparison functions STRING<, STRING>, STRING<=,
  STRING>=, STRING/=, STRING-LESSP, STRING-GREATERP, STRING-NOT-GREATERP,
  STRING-NOT-LESSP, STRING-NOT-EQUAL now return the index of the first mismatch
  instead of T.

* Fixed a bug: The functions REMOVE-DUPLICATES and DELETE-DUPLICATES produced
  an out-of-bounds error when called on a small sequence, with :FROM-END T
  argument and without :END argument.

Portability
-----------

* Updated support for DJGPP.

Other modifications
-------------------

* The macros SETF, PUSH, POP, PUSHNEW have been completely rewritten.

* Changed internal representation of special form handlers: They now consume
  regular memory. This frees one type tag, which will be used by CLOS
  instances.

* Miscellaneous documentation updates.


24 May 1993
===========

User visible changes
--------------------

* New macro DEFPACKAGE.

* New function FUNCTION-LAMBDA-EXPRESSION.

* New package SCREEN containing some functions for random screen access

  a function of two arguments.

* X3J13 vote <104> is implemented: COMPILE-FILE now binds *READTABLE*.

* X3J13 vote <161> is implemented: SHADOW now accepts strings as well
  as symbols.

* Fixed a bug in the compiler which caused the compiler to crash when
  compiling (CASE key ...) forms with constant key.

* Fixed a bug in the compiler which produced unloadable .fas files
  when compiling forms like (SETF ... (FUNCTION LIST)).

* Fixed a bogus error message in the AREF function.

* The built-in editor on Unix now handles the Delete key the same way
  as the Backspace key or Ctrl-H.

* Fixed a bug in + that occasionally caused (- x x) to return a
  long-float zero which was not EQL to the other zeroes of type LONG-FLOAT.

* Fixed a bug: Correctly do round-to-even when adding two long-floats.

* Fixed a bug: The destructive sequence functions DELETE etc. failed to
  produce an error when called on a sequence of type LIST and with an :END
  argument larger than the list's length.

* Corrected the branch cuts of the complex ATAN and ATANH functions.

Portability
-----------

30 March 1993
=============

User visible changes
--------------------

* Fixed a bug in + that caused the sign of (+ x y) to be wrong when x and y
  were double-floats satisfying  0 < x < -y  or  0 > x > -y .

* New special form LOAD-TIME-VALUE.

* The function DIR now sorts its output.

* A new place (DEFAULT-DIRECTORY) manages the "current directory".

* When LOAD is called with a pathname as argument that contains a parent
  directory component (".."): Ignore the variable *LOAD-PATHS*, avoid an error.

* Fixed TRACE so that functions calling TRACE are correctly handled by
  COMPILE-FILE.

Portability
-----------

* Unix version: Correct handling of system calls that are interrupted
  by signals.

* Finished IRIX support.

Other modifications
-------------------

* Miscellaneous documentation updates.


19 March 1993
=============

User visible changes
--------------------

* Replaced variable *TEMPFILE* by a function EDITOR-TEMPFILE.

Portability
-----------

* Unix version: Corrected detection of ANSI C header files.

* Unix version: Check whether signal handlers are automatically reinstalled
  when activated.

* Made readline library ANSI C compliant and (on Unix) auto-configuring.

* In case there is no room for three extra bits in a symbol pointer,
  allocate three stack words per binding in a VAR frame (instead of two stack
  words). This completes the Amiga 3000/4000 version.

* Completed memory model SPVW_PURE_BLOCKS: There is a large contiguous memory
  area for each kind of Lisp object. This model is used only if memory can
  be allocated at prescribed addresses, for example on Unix with mmap().

* More 386BSD support.

Other modifications
-------------------

* Remove limit on the number of files that may be specified on the command
  line. Limit was 1000.

* Miscellaneous documentation updates.


4 March 1993
============

User visible changes
--------------------

* Fixed a bug in ADJOIN that caused ADJOJN and PUSHNEW to push (key item)
  instead of item onto the list when a :KEY argument was present.

* Amiga version: allow opening of "files" on special devices.

* OS/2 version: Long filenames on DOS (FAT) filesystems no longer produce
  errors. They are now silently truncated to 8+3 characters.

* Unix, Amiga, OS/2 versions: When a pathname is to be fully specified, no
  subdirectory wildcard "**/" or ".../" is allowed. Check this.

Portability
-----------

* Corrected underflow detection in SCALE-FLOAT on 16-bit processors.

* Atari ST version: fixed getenv(), wrote INSTALL instructions.

Other modifications
-------------------

* Miscellaneous documentation updates.


21 February 1993

  DO-ALL-SYMBOLS, DOSEQ, DOHASH.

* LISTEN on file streams opened with :DIRECTION :OUTPUT now returns NIL.

* Pathnames resulting from OPEN on special files are now called
  "file handle streams", they are unbuffered file streams.
  They can now be used as argument in situations where a pathname is expected.

Portability
-----------

* The `target' and `configure' scripts no longer depend on awk.

* Support Sun4 with 32 bit address range (kernel architecture "Sun4m") as
  well as Sun4 with 29 bit address range (kernel architecture "Sun4", "Sun4c).

* Can now exploit the shared memory facilities of SunOS 4.1 and of Linux.

* Added support for 386 UHC UNIX System V release 4.

Other modifications
-------------------

* Implemented memory model SPVW_PURE_PAGES where memory is divided
  into many small pages each containing objects of the same type.

* Fixed up source for systems without window streams.

* lispbibl.d, constobj.d: reorder the stream types such that the test for
  file stream becomes faster.

* /usr/local/lib/aclocal.m4, configure.in, unixconf.h.in: prefix my own local

11 January 1993
===============

User visible changes
--------------------
