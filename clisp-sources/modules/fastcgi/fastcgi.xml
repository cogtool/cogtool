<simpara>
The &fastcgi-link; module speeds up &clisp; CGI
scripts launched by a Web server.  Working with a
&fastcgi-link;-enabled Web server such as &apache; with
&mod-fastcgi;, a &clisp; program using the &fastcgi-link;
protocol will run many times faster than a conventional CGI program.
The performance improvements stem from the fact that the script's
process remains running across &http; requests, eliminating startup
overhead and allowing for caching of data structures and other resources.  This
is the same approach used is in other languages (e.g., <ulink
url="http://perl.apache.org">mod_perl</ulink> for Perl).  </simpara>

<simpara>When this module is present, &features-var; contains the
 symbol <constant>:FASTCGI</constant>.</simpara>

<section id="fcgi-overview"><title>Overview of &fastcgi-link;</title>

<para>
Traditional CGI programs work by doing input/output with the Web
server via the following channels:
<orderedlist>
<listitem><simpara>
Examining environment variables; e.g., <envar>HTTP_USER_AGENT</envar> is the
variable set by the Web server to name the browser used
</simpara></listitem>
<listitem><simpara>
Reading from standard input.  E.g., to get input data in a "method=POST" request
</simpara></listitem>
<listitem><simpara>
Writing an &http; response document (usually "Content-type:
text/html") to the standard output, for eventual transmission
back to the browser client
</simpara></listitem>
<listitem><simpara>
Writing error messages to the standard error, usually captured
by the Web server and logged in its log files.
</simpara></listitem>
</orderedlist>
</para>

<simpara>
&fastcgi-link; involves replacing calls the standard routines to do
the above with calls in the <quote role="package">FASTCGI</quote> package.  These calls will then
work exactly as before when the program is invoked as a CGI, but will
also work when invoked by a &fastcgi-link;-enabled Web server.
</simpara>
<simpara>
&fastcgi-link; programs persist across &http; requests, and thus incur
startup overhead costs only once.  For Lisp Web programs, this overhead
can be substantial: code must be
compiled and loaded, files and databases must be opened, etc.  Further,
because the program stays running from &http; request to &http; request,
it can cache information in memory such as database connections
or large in-memory data structures.

<section id="fcgi-functionality"><title>Functions in Package <quote role="package">FASTCGI</quote></title>
<para>Access to
&fastcgi-link; is via these functions in package <quote role="package">FASTCGI</quote>.

<variablelist>

	<!-- IS-CGI -->
<varlistentry><term><code>(FASTCGI:IS-CGI)</code></term>
<listitem><simpara>
Returns &t; if the &clisp; program has been launched as a traditional
CGI rather than in &fastcgi-link;.  In traditional CGI, program I/O is
via operating system environment variables and standard file streams.
Under &fastcgi-link;, I/O is done directly with the Web server via
the &fastcgi-link; protocol.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry>

	<!-- ACCEPT -->
<varlistentry><term>
<code>(FASTCGI:ACCEPT)</code> <replaceable>cgi-forms</replaceable>
<code>(FASTCGI:FINISH)</code>
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
In &fastcgi-link; mode, the program loops,
<function>ACCEPT</function>ing to begin the execution of an &http;
request, and <function>FINISH</function>ing to signal that the script
is finished writing its response to the &http; request.  <function>ACCEPT</function>
blocks until the next &http; request comes in, returning &t; if there is
a new request to handle, and &nil; if no more &http; requests will
occur, usually because the Web server itself has terminated, in which
case the &fastcgi-link; server loop should also exit.
</simpara>
<para>
A typical &fastcgi-link; top-level server loop looks like:
<programlisting language="lisp">
(do ()
    ((not (fastcgi:accept)))
  (run-my-script)
  (fastcgi:finish))
</programlisting>

</para></listitem></varlistentry>

	<!-- GETENV -->
<varlistentry><term><code>(FASTCGI:GETENV
<replaceable>varname</replaceable>)</code></term>
<listitem><simpara>
Use in place of &getenv; to get the value of the environment variable
named <replaceable>varname</replaceable>, which should be a string.
Unlike &getenv;, which accesses the actual host operating system environment,
<function>FASTCGI:GETENV</function> obtains its environment via
the Web server, over its FastCGI communications channel.
For more information, see the &fastcgi-link; Web site.
Returns &nil; if <replaceable>varname</replaceable> is not defined in
the operating system environment.  See <ulink
url="http://www.cgi101.com/class/ch3/text.html">here</ulink> for a
list of useful variables.  You must first have called
<function>ACCEPT</function> and not yet have called
<function>FINISH</function>.  </simpara></listitem></varlistentry>

	<!-- WRITE-STDOUT -->
<varlistentry><term><code>(FASTCGI:WRITE-STDOUT
&string-r;)</code></term>
<listitem><simpara>
Use in place of standard Lisp calls which print to standard output
(i.e., as part of the &http; response).
You must first have called <function>ACCEPT</function> and not yet have
called <function>FINISH</function>.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry>

	<!-- WRITE-STDERR -->
<varlistentry><term><code>(FASTCGI:WRITE-STDERR
&string-r;)</code></term>
<listitem><simpara>
Use in place of standard Lisp calls which print to
standard error. Rather than being part of
the &http; response, data written to standard error are usually
collected by the Web server in its error log.  This is useful
for diagnostic purposes.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry>

	<!-- SLURP-STDIN -->
<varlistentry><term><code>(FASTCGI:SLURP-STDIN)</code></term>
<listitem><simpara>
Reads in the entirety of standard input and returns it as a string.
This is usually done for &http; requests with
<literal>METHOD="post"</literal>, when the data are passed to the CGI
script via standard input rather than via the environment variable
<envar>QUERY_STRING</envar>.  There is no way to read standard input
in pieces, which could be a problem, say, for &http; uploads of very large files.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry>

	<!-- OUT -->
<varlistentry><term><code>(FASTCGI:OUT
<replaceable>tree</replaceable>)</code></term>
<listitem><simpara>
Like <function>WRITE-STDOUT</function>, except that
<replaceable>tree</replaceable>
may be an arbitrarily nested list structure containing (at the leaves)
numbers and strings.  For example,
<literal>(FASTCGI:OUT '("foo" (" " 10 " " 20)))</literal>
will write the string <literal>"foo 10 20"</literal>.  This function
is useful when building strings in memory for display.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry>

<section id="fcgi-example"><title>&fastcgi-link; Example</title>

<para>

Below is a simple example CGI script using &fastcgi-link;.

<programlisting language="lisp">
#!/usr/local/bin/clisp -q -K full

(defun newline () (format nil "~%"))
(do ((count 1 (1+ count)))
	((not (fastcgi:accept)) nil)

    (fastcgi:out "Content-type: text/plain" (newline) (newline))
    (fastcgi:out
     "I am running in mode: " (if (fastcgi:is-cgi) "CGI" "FastCGI") (newline)
     "This is execution no.: " count (newline)
     "The browser string is '" (fastcgi:getenv "HTTP_USER_AGENT") "'" (newline))

    (fastcgi:finish))
</programlisting>

<section id="fcgi-build"><title>Building and configuring the
  &fastcgi-link; Interface</title>
<para>
It is necessary to download the &fastcgi-link; developers' kit, build it,
and install it, before building &clisp; with &fastcgi-link; support.
You also need to upgrade your Web server to speak the &fastcgi-link;
protocol.  For &apache; this means building in &mod-fastcgi;, either statically
or dynamically, and then adding a line to your &apache; config like:
<programlisting language="apache">
     Addhandler fastcgi-script .fcgi
</programlisting>
After that, you can convert <filename>foo.cgi</filename> by linking it
to a script names <filename>foo.fcgi</filename>.  Since a &fastcgi-link;
script is also a valid CGI script, it can be run unmodified in either
mode.
