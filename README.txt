CogTool is a general purpose UI prototyping tool with a difference--
it automatically evaluates your design with a predictive human
performance model (a "cognitive crash dummy"). Simply create a
storyboard of your design idea with sketches, images or on a canvas
with CogTool's widgets, demonstrate tasks on that storyboard, then
press a button to produce a valid cognitive model predicting how long
it will take a skilled user to complete those tasks. CogTool can be
used today to baseline your current interface, or compare competitors'
interfaces, and predict how much better your new designs will be.
